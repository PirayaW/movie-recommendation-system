With two brides both pining for him, Victor must decide between his love-at-first-sight fianc? Victoria, or his tragic corpse bride Emily. Victor messed up his vows during a wedding rehearsal, and is traveling through the woods, reciting his vows. He stops to rest in the woods,and while practicing, he gets them right and puts his wedding ring on a finger-shaped stick in the ground and says his wedding vows.

As the objects of betrothal, Victor and Victoria met for the first time the night before their wedding.

Victor suddenly finds himself married to another woman, a voluptuous bombshell bride who also happens to be dead. Whisked away to the Land of the Dead, Victor finds out that living amongst corpses is not as easy as it seems. Heads easily loose their owners and eyes never seem to stay in their sockets, an adjustment that Victor seems reluctant to accept.

Lightning McQueen has to work hard and finds friendship and love in the simple locals, changing its values during his stay in the small town and becoming a true winner. Lightning McQueen, a hotshot rookie race car driven to succeed, discovers that life is about the journey, not the finish line, when he finds himself unexpectedly detoured in the sleepy Route 66 town of Radiator Springs. On route across the country to the big Piston Cup Championship in California to compete against two seasoned pros, McQueen gets to know the town's offbeat characters--including Sally, a snazzy 2002 Porsche, Doc Hudson, a 1951 Hudson Hornet with a mysterious past, and Mater, a rusty but trusty tow truck, who help him realize that there are more important things than trophies, fame and sponsorship. Lightning McQueen is a cocky, rookie race car. Speeding on his way to a big race, he crashes into Radiator Springs, destroying lots of the inhabitants belongings. In order to make up for what he did, the cocky roadster is sentenced to community service. Though he will do anything to get away from the work, McQueen must learn to respect and bond with the Radiator Springs inhabitants in order to get out of the town and back on the racetracks. Lightning McQueen is a young, hotshot rookie race car in the last race of the season. At the end of the race, he finds out he is tied with Chick Hicks and The King.

Accidentally lost en route to California for the tie-breaker, he crashes through Radiator Springs on Route 66, destroying the road and some property. Forced to remain in town until he repairs them, he's stuck in a small community whose tight-knit inhabitants accept neither his selfishness nor bad attitude.

And now it's up to Sulley and Mike to send Boo back in her door before anybody finds out, especially two evil villains such as Sulley's main rival as a scarer, chameleon-like Randall (a monster that Boo is very afraid of), who possesses the ability to change the color of his skin, and Mike and Sulley's boss Mr. Waternoose, the chairman and chief executive officer of Monsters, Inc.

Since monsters are actually terrified of children it's a major cause for alarm and a major headache for Sulley and Mike. In a land of monsters, James P. Sullivan is king. He and his coworker/ friend Mike Wazowski are two of many monsters that work for Monsters Inc. a utility company that generates power for a very paranoid and nervous city of monsters.

Sulley, the number one frightener, one day accidentally lets a human child into the monster world. Since kids are supposed to be poisonous and carry loads of diseases, pandemonium ensues.

She and her male counterpart, Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives. Set in a future North America known as ""Panem"", the Capitol selects a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18 from each of the twelve outlying districts to compete in the annual ""Hunger Games"", a televised fight-to-the-death. The film is centered around Katniss Everdeen - a 16-year-old girl from District 12, who volunteers for her 12-year-old sister, Prim, when Prim's name is chosen - and Katniss's fellow District 12 tribute, Peeta Mellark, with whom she has some rather dramatic history. Katniss is then rushed to the Capitol, where she undergoes intense training before being thrust into the arena to fight to become the victor of the seventy-fourth annual Hunger Games. In order to control future rebellions by remembering the past rebellion, the Powers That Be of the dystopian society of Panem force two youngsters from each of the twelve districts to participate in The Hunger Games. The rules are very simple: the twenty-four players must kill each other and survive in the wilderness until only one remains. The games are broadcast through the Capital and the twelve districts to entertain and intimidate the population. In District 12, teenager Katniss Everdeen is a great hunter and archer. When her younger sister, Primrose Everdeen, is selected as one of the ""tributes"" of their district, Katniss volunteers to take her place in the games. Together with Peeta Mellark, they head by train to the Capital to be prepared for the brutal game. Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take the place of her sister to be placed into a revolutionary game called The Hunger Games, where kids kill each other for one to take the crown. Katniss fights for herself and her sister with another boy from her district, Peeta Mellark. Katniss Everdeen lives in a place called Panem. Panem lies on what used to be North America. Panem is split up into 12 districts. Each year, every district is forced to randomly choose two tributes-one girl and one boy- to fight in the annual Hunger Games. A fight to the death on live television. Katniss Everdeen takes her sisters place when she is called to be the tribute of the 74th annual Hunger Games.

Nobody wants the prize more than young Charlie, but as his family is so poor that buying even one bar of chocolate is a treat, buying enough bars to find one of the five golden tickets is unlikely in the extreme. But in movieland, magic can happen. Charlie, along with four somewhat odious other children, get the chance of a lifetime and a tour of the factory.

Those that eventually get the golden tickets will be exposed to all of Wonka's magical secrets, the latest rumored to be that of the everlasting gobstopper, a candy that never gets smaller.

Years later, Ella's (Lily James) father (Ben Chaplin) reveals that an old acquaintance, Lord Tremaine, has passed away and that he has chosen Tremaine's widow (Cate Blanchett), who has two daughters of her own, Drizella (Sophie McShera) and Anastasia (Holliday Grainger), as his second wife. Ella welcomes her stepfamily warmly, despite the stepsisters' less than pleasant attitudes and her needing to protect her friends from her stepmother's cat, Lucifer. Soon after, Ella's father goes abroad on business. Sadly, he becomes ill and also dies. This new loss results in Lady Tremaine revealing her true cold, wicked nature. Desperate for money, she dismisses the servants and forces Ella to do all the work. Even worse, she gives Ella's room to the stepsisters, forces her to sleep in the attic, and won't even let her eat with the family. One morning, after Ella, not wanting to sleep in the cold attic, sleeps by the fireplace, her soot covered face leads her stepsisters to mock and dub her as Cinderella, which Lady Tremaine (and even Ella herself) calls her. Crushed by their cruelty, Ella goes for a ride in the woods, where she encounters a hunting party. She meets one of the hunters (Richard Madden), who claims to be an apprentice named Kit who lives in the palace. Unknown to her, he's actually the only son of the land's dying king (Derek Jacobi). Despite never learning her name, Kit (a nickname given to him by his father) is enchanted by Ella's charm, kindness, and unique outlook on life and becomes obsessed with her. Upon learning that he has little time left, the King insists that Kit find a bride at an upcoming ball. Despite the law saying that he must marry a princess, Kit can't get over the mystery girl and talks his father into letting every eligible maiden in the land attend. When the ball is announced, the Tremaine family is ecstatic at the prospect of marrying into royalty. However, when Lady Tremaine refuses to buy Ella a new dress, she fashions one herself from an old dress of her mother's with help from the mice. The night of the ball, Ella tries to join her stepfamily on the way out, but Lady Tremaine, claiming that her mere presence will disgrace them, leads her daughters in ripping up the dress before leaving without her. Ella runs into the garden in tears and encounters an old beggar woman, who reveals herself to be her Fairy Godmother (Helena Bonham Carter). She uses her magic to turn a pumpkin into a magnificent carriage, four mice into horses, two lizards into footmen, and a goose into a coachman, as well as turning Ella's dress into a gorgeous blue gown complete with glass shoes before sending her on her way with the warning that the spell only lasts until midnight. At the ball, Ella wins the coveted first dance with Kit, whose true identity she's pleasantly surprised to learn. This irritates the Grand Duke (Stellan Skarsg?rd), who's secretly promised Kit to a princess, a fact Lady Tremaine overhears. After dancing, Ella and Kit tour the palace and grounds together, slowly falling in love, but before he can learn her name, the clock strikes 11:59, forcing her to flee, dropping one of her glass shoes in the process. She manages to get away before the stroke of midnight and hides the other shoe in her room as a memento. Soon after, the King dies, but not before giving his son permission to find his love. Once it's announced that every maiden in the kingdom is to try on the shoe, Ella goes to her room for hers, only to find Lady Tremaine waiting with it in hand, having figured out her identity from her attitude after the ball. Lady Tremaine demands that Ella make her head of the royal family and give her daughters proper husbands when she becomes queen and when she refuses, Lady Tremaine smashes the shoe and locks Ella in her room. She then brings the shoe and identity of the mystery girl to the Grand Duke and talks him into rewarding her with title of countess and worthy husbands for her daughters. He takes the shattered shoe to Kit, hoping to convince him to forget the mystery girl, but this makes him more determined than ever to find his love. The Grand Duke and the captain of the guards (Nonso Anozie) lead a garrison to try the remaining shoe on all the maidens in the land, all of whom are rejected by its magic, before arriving at the Tremaine estate. When the shoe rejects both stepsisters, they turn to leave, only to hear Ella singing thanks to the mice opening her bedroom window. The Grand Duke tries to leave anyway but is stopped by one of the men, who reveals himself to be Kit in disguise and demands that the captain investigate the sound. Once Ella is found, Lady Tremaine tries to forbid her from trying on the shoe, but is overruled by the captain. Sure enough, the shoe fits and Ella leaves with Kit after forgiving her stepmother, who later is forced to leave the kingdom with her daughters and the Grand Duke, never to return. Kit and Ella are married and crowned king and queen. The Fairy Godmother narrates that they become the land's most beloved monarchs, ruling with the courage and kindness she promised her mother. Ella is a down-to-earth, innocent young girl with a threatening stepmother and stepsisters. But when she meets the man of her dreams, she is twirling down the dance floor in glass slippers and blue dress, with the help of her fairy godmother. But she better watch the clock! Ella is living a great life until her mother passes away. Ella's father remarried a ""good"" woman with two wretched daughters. One day Ella's father goes on a journey and never returned because of death. Ella gets stuck living with her ""family"" until she rides in the woods and meets a prince. The Prince holds a ball expecting to see Ella there. The stepmother admits her jealousy and locks up who she call Cinderella in her attic room.

After Kate, Lizzie's rival, finds this all out and swears to keep things a secret from Ungermeyer, Gordo finds out Paolo is using Lizzie so he won't get sued. She won't believe him, yet he continues to cover for her, who knew about this since the beginning. Things get a little to out of control, and soon Ungermeyer comes to the obvious that Lizzie has been faking sick to sneak out. Gordo tells Ungermeyer that it was him sneaking around, which gets his a cozy seat on the next plane to America. But as he's getting on the plane, Isabella, who just returned from an island, is getting off a plane. She found out about Lizzie and demands her bodyguards tell her who she is. But the only one who can tell her is Gordo. Meanwhile, Matt is at home, pretending to his parents that he misses his older sister just so they can go to Rome and get her, and he can make money of the embarrassing tapes. On the plane, their parents figure out what Lizzie's trip held, and Matt must explain all he knows in a 14 hour trip. The night that Lizzie and Paolo perform, Isabella and Gordo find Lizzie getting ready backstage. They tell her everything, and now she believes them. Lizzie tells Isabella to go ahead, but Lizzie must still perform after the brunette singer states that she is not blonde, and Paolo will find an excuse to leave. So as they go on, Isabella comes up with a clever plan and tells the operators to turn up Paolo's microphone in the middle of the song, so the audience can hear his horrible voice instead of his gorgeous lipsynching. When he's caught, he runs off and tells paparazzi it was just his voice. But no one believes him, so thats the end of Paolo. Isabella introduces Lizzie as her new American friend. They start an upbeat pop duet of the original Paolo Lizzie ballad, just as Ungermeyer, the students, and Lizzie's family come in to watch her. Then Isabella leaves Lizzie to sing by herself. She tries to run off but Gordo tells her she can do it. She pretty much sums up her trip to Roma in song. The movie ends with Lizzie getting grounded, Matt being wanted out of country for blackmailing family, Kate and Ethan, the heartthrob, enjoying spaghetti, and a sweet kiss on the balcony of the hotel shared between Gordo and Lizzie. When Lizzie and Gordo finally graduate, Rome, Italy, here they come! Lizzie, Gordo, and all the new high schoolers to be are excited about seeing Roma. Not so excited when they're accompanied by the not so sunshiny Mrs. ungermeyer. So when Lizzie is discovered by Paolo, a famous 17 year old Italian pop star, she must sneak away from Ungermeyer, the class, and everyone associated except Gordo. She finds out she was picked out because Lizzie, with her blonde hair, looks like the brunette half of the duet, Isabella. Isabella and Paolo have broken up, and Isabella is on the island. Lizzie thinks Paolo is falling for her, but all he's doing is trying not to get sued. When she finds out from Gordo, she won't believe him. Yet, he covers for her to the extent of getting sent home. Meeting Isabella there, he explains it all to her wondering mind. When they foul out Paolo at the Music Awards, Isabella and Lizzie sing together a pop version of a softer ballad. Lizzie finished the song. Later on, Lizzie apologizes to Gordo, and they seem to be getting along very well. Will a new Romance in Roma evolve?

0107120,Hocus Pocus,"300 years have passed since the Sanderson sisters were executed for practicing dark witchcraft. Returning to life thanks to a combination of a spell spoken before their demise and the accidental actions of Max, the new-kid-in-town, the sisters have but one night to secure their continuing existence... More than 300 years ago, 3 witches were sentenced to die in Salem, Massachusetts and a boy was turned into a cat (a black cat, naturally). Now it's Halloween, and the witches (who fly on [I kid you not] vacuum cleaners) are back. This time, they've got their eyes on immortal life and have turned their wrath on trick-or-treaters and it's up to the 300-year-old cat to save the day. 300 years ago, the Sanderson sisters had bewitched people. Now it's Halloween 1993 and Max Dennison has lit the candle that would bring the witches back to life! Now Max, Allison, and Dani must save all the kids in Salem from the witches including leader Winifred, goofy Sarah, and high-strung Mary who will steal the lives of children! In the year 1693, sisters, Winifred, Mary and Sarah were executed for their unforgiveble witchecraft. They captured and sucked the life out of children. Just before their execution, Winifred made a curse - a curse that when a virgin lights the black flame candle on Halloween light, in their house, they shall return ... 1993, 300 years later, Max decides to light the candle in order to scare his irritating sister Dani and his wannabe girlfriend Alison. Now, the three Witches are back ready for a night of fun, magic and horror in the now modern area of Salem. In the year 1693, 3 sisters, Winifred, Mary and Sarah were executed for their unforgivable witchcraft. One fateful Halloween night, that unpleasant honor went to adorable little Emily Binx, sister of teenage Thackery, who immediately ran to his sibling's aid when he heard she'd been lured by Sarah Sanderson to the witches' home in the woods. This was not a well thought out plan though, and the cost was not only the life of his sister Emily, but his own humanity as well. Emily's lifeforce was drained from her body by the three Sanderson witches, and big brother Thackery Binx was transformed into an immortal black cat, cursed to live forever with the guilt of his failure to save his sister! Luckily for the rest of the children of Salem, the Sanderson sisters were captured that night and hung for their crimes, but not before their living book of spells revealed to them a curse to bring the three back from the dead on All Hallow's Eve when a virgin lights the black flame candle. 300 years later, teenager Max Dennison is a newcomer to Salem, struggling to adjust after growing up in a California lifestyle. It isn't going well for Max. Bullies are stealing his sneakers right off his feet, the girl of his dreams snubs him due to his lack of interest in Halloween, and his little sister, Dani, is ever the pest.

Just when he believes things are looking up after he and Dani convince dream-girl Allison to take them to the old Sanderson house, Max's efforts to impress the girl lead him to light the black-flame candle himself, bringing Sarah, Mary, and Winifred Sanderson back from the dead! From there on out, it's a non-stop, fun-filled chase as the witches pursue the children, determined to make sassy-mouthed Dani the subject of their next youth spell, which must be performed before dawn or else the witches will be gone forever! With the immortal, talking black cat Binx guiding them along, Max, Dani, and Allison work together to outrun, outwit, and outlast the evil trio and their magical arsenal, with the fate of all the children of Salem hanging in the balance!

There's a secret war being waged in the homes and neighborhoods of Earth that the humans don't even know about; an eternal struggle between two great armies: the Cats and the Dogs. The film follows a Cat's plan to destroy a new vaccine, that if developed, would destroy all human allergies to Dogs, and the Dogs' efforts to stop the Cats. Specifically, it's the story of a young pup whose job it is to guard the vaccine. Other dogs include a wise older dog who watches out for him, a large friendly dog, and a small dog who serves as an electronics expert. Jeff Goldblum is the human scientist that invented the vaccine. Cats and dogs, known to mankind only as cuddly pets and man's best friend, have engaged in a fierce and merciless battle: Mr. Tinkles, a ruthless cat, is plotting intensively to achieve nothing less than world domination. His main target is Professor Brody, who is working on a medicine to rid people from dog hair allergies. Yet Mr. Tinkles strives to get to the substance, analyze it and then have it turned into a means of rendering all humans of the world aggressively allergic to any kind of dog. Cats would rule, as dogs would then be exterminated. But Mr. Tinkles did not bother to waste any thoughts on little Lou, the Brody family's new puppy, who never before has heard of dog agents and the major protective mission they fulfill towards the unsuspecting Brody family. Together with Butch and a few other dog agents from the neighbourhood, Lou desperately tries to hinder Mr. Tinkles in his sinister plans to take over the world.

0097351,Field of Dreams,"Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella hears a voice in his corn field tell him, ""If you build it, he will come."" He interprets this message as an instruction to build a baseball field on his farm, upon which appear the ghosts of Shoeless Joe Jackson and the other seven Chicago White Sox players banned from the game for throwing the 1919 World Series. When the voices continue, Ray seeks out a reclusive author to help him understand the meaning of the messages and the purpose for his field. ""If you build it, he will come"", is what thirty-six year old novice farmer Ray Kinsella hears several times over the course of days from a bodiless voice emanating from somewhere in the corn field on his Iowa farm, the voice which no others around him hears. Later, he has a vision that the ""it"" is a baseball field, the ""he"" Shoeless Joe Jackson, infamous for his association in the Chicago 8, the eight players of the 1919 Chicago White Sox who were banned for life from the sport for throwing games during that year's World Series in exchange for money from gamblers. Although it was proved that Jackson did take money, it was never proved that he participated in throwing any of the games. Ray grew up with baseball, his long deceased father, John Kinsella, who played in the minor leagues, lived in Chicago during that infamous baseball year, and told stories to Ray often about it and his hero Shoeless Joe when Ray was growing up. Ray was estranged from his father at the time of his death, something that Ray now regrets. With the moral support of his wife Annie Kinsella, Ray tears up part of their corn field to build that baseball field. Ray eventually hears the voice telling him other things, always without a clear understanding on Ray's part of what it all means. One he believes has to do with famed '60's writer Terence Mann, now a recluse who stopped writing because he, renowned as *the* voice of his generation, didn't always want to be the answer to his generation's problems. Another he believes has to do with Archie ""Moonlight"" Graham, who played only one half of one inning of one major league game in 1922, and who died in 1972. Ray's voice led path may be difficult to achieve since cynical Mann may not have the same direction of the voice as Ray, and since Graham is dead. Ray will have to work through these puzzles to understand the full meaning of what the voice wants for him, which may not happen if he and Annie lose the farm and thus the baseball field, a real possibility due to the baseball field taking away from earning income from the farm, especially as Annie's cutthroat brother Mark, who says he is looking out for his sister's best interest, will do whatever needed to get Ray back to what Mark considers reality of earning a living from the farm. An Iowa corn farmer, hearing voices, interprets them as a command to build a baseball diamond in his fields; he does, and the Chicago White Sox come.",0265662|0109127|0108037|0104868|0107985|0106611|0087538|0074174|0110363|0067992|0109520|0085334

As the Cubs head for the National League Championship series, Jack agrees to hand over Henry's contract to the New York Yankees for 25 million dollars.

A home run by the opposing team is hit, and, corresponding with the tradition, must be thrown back. Henry ends up throwing the ball back, but he throws it back all the way to home plate on a dead line. Henry is quickly signed by the Cubs and is the biggest phenom in Major League Baseball. But, is all the fame and fortune too much for him to handle at such a young age, or will he continue as the best pitcher in baseball?

He becomes a rookie pitching sensation, but learns that fame and a major baseball career have costs.

Alex is recruited by Alan Blunt to continue the mission. He is sent to Cornwall to investigate a new computer system, which Darrius Sayle has created. He plans to give the new computer systems to every school in the country, but Mr. Blunt has other ideas and Alex must find out what it is. An outwardly ordinary orphaned teenager student Alex Rider who lives with his uncle, a boring bank manager, or so it seems until his uncle, Ian Rider, disappears under mysterious circumstances.

Recruited by Mr. Blunt and Mrs. Jones, and armed with special gadgets, he embarks on his first mission. Billionaire Darrius Sayle is donating a free Stormbreaker mega-computer to every school in Britain. But is there more to his generosity than meets the eye? Going undercover, he infiltrates Sayle's compound. He meets the tycoon's sinister sidekicks, vixen publicist Nadia Vole and the disfigured mute Mr. Grin, and tests out the impressive and secretive Stormbreaker computer. While exploring a restricted area, Alex begins to figure out the mysterious Stormbreakers--he knows he's onto something big. Suddenly, Sayle and his evil henchmen capture Alex. Using his cunning and his MI6 gadgets, Alex manages to escape. He hitches a ride to London to stop Sayle from activating the Stormbreakers and releasing their secret weapon throughout Britain.

Orphaned when he was an infant, fourteen year old Alex Rider has since lived in the London home of his uncle, Ian Rider, a security specialist with a bank. As Ian is often away on business, a fact that bothers Alex since he loves his uncle and wishes he could spend more time with him, Alex has been largely brought up by his housekeeper of nine years, an American expatriate named Jack. After Ian is killed in a car accident, Alex eventually learns that his uncle was not the mild mannered white collar worker he purported to be, but rather an agent in a special ops division of MI6, and that Ian had actually been grooming Alex to follow in his footsteps by providing him with special skills, such as scuba diving, self defense/martial arts, and language training. Ian's handlers, Alan Blunt and Mrs. Jones, co-opt Alex to take over the case on which Ian was working and for which he was killed, namely following the exploits of an American businessman named Darrius Sayle, who wants to provide his new state-of-the-art computer system, Stormbreaker, to every British child. If Alex is able to uncover Darrius' plot, he will find that the lives of millions of Britons are in danger, and that if killed will be done at the hands of Darrius' old friend, the British Prime Minister.

0059742,The Sound of Music,"In 1930's Austria, a young woman named Maria is failing miserably in her attempts to become a nun. When the Navy captain Georg Von Trapp writes to the convent asking for a governess that can handle his seven mischievous children, Maria is given the job. The Captain's wife is dead, and he is often away, and runs the household as strictly as he does the ships he sails on. The children are unhappy and resentful of the governesses that their father keeps hiring, and have managed to run each of them off one by one. When Maria arrives, she is initially met with the same hostility, but her kindness, understanding, and sense of fun soon draws them to her and brings some much-needed joy into all their lives -- including the Captain's. Eventually he and Maria find themselves falling in love, even though Georg is already engaged to a Baroness and Maria is still a postulant. The romance makes them both start questioning the decisions they have made. Their personal conflicts soon become overshadowed, however, by world events. Austria is about to come under the control of Germany, and the Captain may soon find himself drafted into the German navy and forced to fight against his own country. Maria had longed to be a nun since she was a young girl, yet when she became old enough discovered that it wasn't at all what she thought. Often in trouble and doing the wrong things, Maria is sent to the house of a retired naval captain, named Captain Von Trapp, to care for his children. Von Trapp was widowed several years before and was left to care for seven 'rowdy' children. The children have run off countless governesses. Maria soon learns that all these children need is a little love to change their attitudes. Maria teaches the children to sing, and through her, music is brought back into the hearts and home of the Von Trapp family. Unknowingly, Maria and Captain Von Trapp are falling helplessly in love, except there are two problems, the Captain is engaged, and Maria is a postulant! Baron Von Trapp, a widower, runs his home near Salzburg like the ship he once commanded. That changes when Maria arrives from the convent to be the new governess of his seven children. Their romps through the hills inspire all to sing and to find joy in the smallest things -- like raindrops on window panes. With a renewed zest for life, the baron hosts a party to introduce his new fiance. Maria knows then she does not want to be a nun. She marries the baron. The happy ever after part is threatened when Austria's new German rulers want the baron back in military service. Maria is a failure as a nun. The Mother Superior sends her off in answer to a letter from a retired naval captain for a governess for his seven children. She goes to their house and finds that she is the latest in a long line of governesses run off by the children. She teaches the children to sing and that becomes their bonding force, of course leading her to fall in love with their father and marries him. As this is happening Austria votes to be assumed by Germany on the eve of World war II. Captain Baron von Trapp is a widowed ex-naval officer with seven children who serve only to remind him of his deceased wife. The Von Trapp home is thus turned into a gloomy place of order and discipline, until the arrival of a new governess: Frauline Marie who is from a nearby Salzburg abbey. Marie shows the Von Trapp children the miracle of the Sound of Music, and teaches them how to sing. Captain von Trapp's heart opens up to feelings he had forgotten and he and Marie fall in love. Marie and Georg von Trapp are married, only to have their world brought down around them by the 1938 Anschluss of Austria, where Nazi Germany takes control of the country and demands that Captain von Trapp assume a position in the German Navy.

Tino Tonitini, the show's narrator, is an average sarcastic kid with a good heart and isn't afraid to tell his Mom about his life (actually she usually tricks him into telling her). Tish Katsufrakus comes from an old world family and loves art, music, and all the things her friends find dull. Carver is the athletic one with a shoe fetish. Finally, Lor McQuarrie is the tom-boy. Together, they play pool, eat pizza, and be kids in every sense of the word. The story is about the lives of 4 friends on the weekends in Bahia Bay, California. Tino Tonitini is a sarcastic boy who narrates the show and usually speaks first and last on the episodes. His parents divorced when he was young, and his mother is a down-to-earth health-nut who knows what goes on in Tino's head. Tish Katsufrakis is a artsy, brainy girl who comes from a country that no one has heard of and is only referred to as the ""old country."" Her mother has broken English and most people don't understand what she says, so when they finally get it and repeat what they think they heard, she always responds with, ""Is what I say."" Tish also enjoys Sheakspheare and is notably the most scholarly of the four. Lor McQuarrie is a Scottish tomboy who usually beats boys at sports and is the only girl in a family of 14 brothers. Carver Descartes is a somewhat superficial shoe lover who knows more about the fashion world and has an annoying teenage sister and a little brother who can be troublesome. Carver is obsessed with being cool and is very aware of his appearance. Each weekend the group searches for the perfect weekend. They hang out around town, get pizza, and usually encounter some sort of problem. Tino's mother always offers sound advice which the kids usually don't take and they end up figuring things out on their own. She often gives this advice at dinner while trying to get Tino to eat something unusual such as tofu brownies or ostrich meat. The kids usually hang out at places like the mall where they usually get chili cheese fries and chug-a-freezes, the arcade, or a pizza place with different and sometimes silly themes. Each episode always ends at a final thought and ""Later days,"" a slang term used to say goodbye.

One day, his father, a zoo owner, explains that the municipality is no longer supporting the zoo and he has hence decided to move to Canada, where the animals the family owns would also be sold. They board on a Japanese cargo ship with the animals and out of the blue, there is a storm, followed by a shipwrecking. Pi survives in a lifeboat with a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena and a male Bengal tiger nicknamed Richard Parker. They are adrift in the Pacific Ocean, with aggressive hyena and Richard Parker getting hungry. Pi needs to find a way to survive. An aspiring Canadian author interviews the Indian storyteller Pi Patel to hear the firsthand account of his adventures.

One night aboard their Japanese cargo ship in the middle of the ocean, a violent and deadly storm hits and sinks nearly all that Pi holds dear.

They were brought together by Pi's deceased father's longtime friend Francis, who Pi calls Mamaji, who knew Pi's family when they lived in Pondicherry, India, where the writer met Mamaji. Mamaji felt Pi telling the writer his story would be karmic as the writer was a Canadian in French India, and Pi an Indian man in French Canada. Pi proceeds to tell him his life story, which starts in Pondicherry as the son of zookeepers, the zoo property where he grew up: how he was given his full name of Piscine Molitor Patel largely on Mamaji's suggestion which included Mamaji teaching him how to swim, why at age eleven he made a concerted and extraordinary effort to shorten his name to Pi, his concurrent belief in several religions as he was growing up which affected his relationships not only with humans but what he wanted it to be with the animals at the zoo, and his mid-teen burgeoning relationship with a dancer named Anandi just before his family decided to make the move to Canada. But the largest and most fascinating part of his story concerns how he ended up on a lifeboat in the middle of the Pacific with the zoo's Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, and the progression of their time and understanding of each other during that close connection, Richard Parker to who he attributes his survival despite they being initial adversaries as a human and a wild carnivorous beast.

0085334,A Christmas Story,"Christmas is approaching and 9 year-old Ralphie wants only one thing: a Red Ryder Range 200 Shot BB gun. When he mentions it at the dinner table, his mother's immediate reaction is that he'll put his eye out. He then decides on a perfect theme for his teacher but her reaction is like his. He fantasizes about what it would be like to be Red Ryder and catch the bad guys. When the big day arrives he gets lots of present under the tree including a lovely gift from his aunt that his mother just adores. But what about the BB gun? Adult Ralph Parker is remembering back to a Christmas season when he was nine years old living with his parents and his younger brother Randy in the northern Indiana town of Holman. Then largely known as Ralphie, he, like most kids, loved Christmas, his favorite time of the year. He often fantasized about things that he knows now would never happen, but that within a kid's mind is totally plausible. That Christmas was memorable for: his contest-obsessed father winning a prize for the first time in his life, that prize which would be the bane of Ralphie's mother's existence; his father's seemingly never-ending battle with the furnace in the house and the neighbor's pack of dogs; his mother's attempts to get Randy to eat, he at a stage when he never ate anything voluntarily; Ralphie's changing view toward the Little Orphan Annie radio program and commercial advertising; Ralphie and his friends Schwartz and Flick's changing battle with Scut Farkus and Grover Dill, their primary bullies; the triple dog dare Schwartz issued to Flick; and Ralphie's new relationship with Lifebuoy soap. But most memorable was what he wanted more than anything for Christmas: an official Red Ryder carbine action 200-shot range model air rifle, aka a BB gun. As it looked increasingly like he was not going to get this prized gift, Ralphie went about trying to manipulate and outwit those he thought would either be the decision makers or influencers of that gift, namely his parents, his teacher, Miss Shields, and the big guy at the North Pole, even if he was in the form of a less than empathetic department store version. Ralphie, a young boy growing up, dreams of owning a Red Rider BB gun. He sets out to convince the world this is the perfect gift. But along the way, he runs into opposition from his parents, his teacher, and even good ol' Santa Claus himself. It's 1940, in the northern Indiana town of Hohman. 9-year-old Ralph ""Ralphie"" Parker wants only one thing for Christmas -- an official Red Ryder carbine-action 200-shot range model BB rifle with a compass in the stock. Between his younger brother Randy and having to handle school bully Scut Farkus, Ralphie doesn't know how he'll ever survive long enough to get the BB gun for Christmas. When Ralph asks his mother for a Red Ryder BB gun for Christmas, she says, ""No, you'll shoot your eye out"". When Mrs. Shields, Ralph's teacher at Harding Elementary School, assigns the class to write a theme about what they want for Christmas, Ralph sees a golden opportunity to express his desire to have a Red Ryder BB gun. Ralph gets a C+ on the theme, and Mrs. Shields has written ""You'll shoot your eye out"" on the theme. Ralph's next plan is to ask Santa Claus for a Red Ryder BB gun, and how does Santa respond? By saying ""You'll shoot your eye out, kid."" By this time, Ralph has had enough of that. When Scut Farkus and his sidekick Grover Dill start in on Ralph while he's on his way home from school that day, Ralph knocks Grover Dill to the ground, beats Scut's face bloody, and then pounds Scut's head on the snow-covered ground several times. Ralph thinks he'll never get the BB gun for Christmas now. And all of the other kids are going to be getting what they want for Christmas. But someone may have planned a surprise for Ralph. It's Christmas time and there's only one thing on Ralphie Parker's Christmas list this year: a Red Ryder Carbine Action 200-Shot, Range Model Air Rifle, but many obstacles stand in the way of his dream because every adult that he confronts keeps telling him he'll shoot his eye out. Meanwhile The Old Man just got a major award (a lamp shaped like a woman's leg), and Mom is making sure The Old Man doesn't come near her turkey, Ralphie's friend gets his tongue stuck to a flag pole, and Ralphie utters the f-word in front of his father. Christmas is drawing nearer and Ralphie visits Santa at the department store in hopes of asking him for his dream gift. Will he receive it? Let's hope so. Ralphie has to convince his parents, his teacher, and Santa that a Red Ryder B.B. gun really is the perfect gift for the 1940s.",0319343|0060345|0058536|0059026|0111070|0039628|0064349|0170016|0066327|0060550|0099785|0338348

She killed a Mimic and it's blood entered her body and she would relive the day before and used her experience to beat the Mimics. Along with a scientist, they tell Cage that the Mimics are being led by something they call the Omega and the one he killed whose blood entered his body is what they call an Alpha who can relive the day when killed. They believe if they can locate the Omega and kill it they can beat the Mimics once and for all. So they tell Cage that the Alpha has some kind of link to the Omega so they believe Cage can see where the Omega is. But Vrataski lost the ability before she could find the Omega. Eventually Cage thinks he knows where the Omega is but to get to the Omega they have to survive the battle wherein they were all killed but no matter how much Cage warns her they always get killed.

Those who remain meet in Boston, where they form an uneasy alliance with Magneto to stop Stryker and rescue Professor X. After the events on Liberty Island, everyone at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters is settling in. Magneto is locked up in a plastic cell, Rogue and Bobby Drake have finally gotten together, and Wolverine has set off to find his origins. But it won't stay quiet for long. After a mutant attack on the President, everyone starts to fear any type of mutant. William Stryker, who plans to stop all mutants, takes over the school, causing Wolverine and his team of mutants to go into hiding. Stryker has managed to capture Xavier and will use him to create another version of Cerebro. Wolverine and the team must now team up with their enemy, Magneto, to stop Stryker before it's too late. Already living in a society that mistrusts them, the mutants are faced with even more discrimination after an unforeseen enemy - who may be a mutant with extraordinary powers - launches a devastating attack. The news of the assault causes a public outcry against the mutants, including renewed support for the Mutant Registration Act, and William Stryker, a military leader rumored to have experimented on mutants (possibly including Wolverine), is among the most vocal supporters of the legislation. Stryker puts into motion a plan to eradicate the mutants and begins an offensive on the X-Men mansion and school. Magneto, having escaped from his plastic prison, forms an unlikely alliance with Professor Xavier to stop Stryker. Meanwhile, Wolverine heads north to investigate his past. A new war between humans and mutants begins after an attempted assassination of the President of the United States. Now, all the mutants must fight together against a common enemy: General William Stryker. Stryker, to further his plan to eradicate all mutants, uses radical methods to get some information from Magneto, and plans an attack to Professor Xavier's school. On the night of the attack, Wolverine is left alone to 'babysit' the young students (Jean Grey and Storm are looking for the mutant assassin, and Xavier is in Magneto's plastic prison, having left Cyclops in its lobby). The plot goes on with a lot of action and many revelations, largely following the comic books. Having returned from the north after finding nothing, Wolverine/Logan watches over the school students for a night as Charles Xavier visits Magneto in his plastic confinement prison and Storm and Jean Grey search for a teleporter mutant known as Nightcrawler who attempted to assassinate the president. Things become deadly as William Stryker, a scientist who has experimented on mutants, leads a siege on Xavier's mansion- few mutants escape. With the school no longer safe, Magneto out of prison and forming a temporary alliance with the X-Men, and Professor Xavier in the hands of Stryker; the mutants team up to stop Stryker's plans to wipe the mutants off the face of the Earth. The X-Men band together to find a mutant assassin who has made an attempt on the President's life, while the Mutant Academy is attacked by military forces.",0120903|0376994|1270798|0458525|1430132|0316654|0145487|1877832|0948470|0413300|1228705|0800369

When the plane lands, Dr. Grant realizes that there is another reason why they are there, that he doesn't know of. Now, Dr. Grant is stuck on an island he has never been on before, with what was a plane journey now turned into a search party. Eight years after the InGen incident, Dr. Alan Grant is happy with his life far from any dinosaurs other than fossilized. Unfortunately, he is extremely short in research money, and therefore accepts the offer of wealthy businessman Paul Kirby: A low flight over isolated Isla Sorna, where InGen's second research site was located, and Dr. Grant can fund his future research for a long time. What Dr. Grant didn't know is that Kirby just needs a dinosaur expert to help him and his wife find their 14-year-old son Eric, who crashed on the island while paragliding. What he did suspect, but never wanted to witness, is that the Velociraptors have evolved into a communicating species (and seemingly all along had the capability to do so), now being smarter than primates. Anxious to fund research for his new theory of velociraptor intelligence, renowned paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant is persuaded by wealthy adventurer Paul Kirby and his wife Amanda to accompany them on an aerial tour of Isla Sorna.

Hosted by Bob Keeshan (at one time, he played Howdy Doody's friend, Clarabell) from the appropriately-named Captain's Place, the Captain was so named because he always wore an overcoat with large, kangaroo-like pouches. Each show featured stories, skits, vaudeville acts, songs, games and other educational activities. Captain Kangaroo's friends were Mr. Green Jeans (who always brought an animal to the show); Dennis, an apprentice handyman and do-it-all person; and Mr. Moose and Bunny Rabbit. Bunny was always mute, but made his point ever-so-cleverly, while Mr. Moose always tricked the Captain into allowing him to stand under a shower of pingpong balls. As the show got on in years, new features were added, including Uncle Backwards (a tape of some simple action, such as peeling an orange or building a doghouse, shown in reverse); ""Picture Pages,"" a matching activity hosted by Bill Cosby; and Slim Goodbody, which taught children about health, nutrition and physical fitness. Many actors, actresses and singers guest starred. In the early 1980s, new formats were attempted, all without success including the early morning ""Wake Up with the Captain"" (which starred new puppet friends and employed the joke-of-the-day); by 1984, the show ended its 29-year CBS run.

1663662,Pacific Rim,"When monstrous creatures, known as Kaiju, started rising from the sea, a war began that would take millions of lives and consume humanity's resources for years on end. To combat the giant Kaiju, a special type of weapon was devised: massive robots, called Jaegers, which are controlled simultaneously by two pilots whose minds are locked in a neural bridge. But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes - a washed up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi) - who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse. For years, Earth is repeatedly attacked by giant monsters called Kaiju that emerge from a portal beneath the Pacific Ocean. The only effective defense is the Jaeger program, massive complex robots that require pairs of neural-linked pilots. However, as each Kaiju attack becomes more powerful and frequent, Humanity must change its tactics. To that end, former Jaeger pilot Raleigh Becket is reactivated as part of a desperate plan to destroy the portal. As Raleigh strives to heal his inner scars and help his new partner conquer hers, an intrepid scientist discovers a way to link to the Kaiju's mind to learn about them. Unfortunately, that proves a mixed blessing as vital information of both sides is inadvertently shared and the stakes rise for a final battle. When giant lizard like creatures come out of the ocean and attack every city killing millions, all the nations come together and build giant robots called Jaegers. They are piloted by two individuals who are linked up to them mentally. While they are able to defeat the creatures whom they call Kaijus, eventually they adapt and even the Jaegers can't stop them. So all the heads of the nations decide to stop the program and to try other tactics. But Pentecost the man in charge of the Jaeger program decide to continue the program. He recruits Raleigh Becket a former Jaeger pilot who left after his co-pilot who's also his brother died. He tries to find a compatible co-pilot and when he finds no one, he gives Pentecost's assistant, a girl named Mako a chance. And when she proves to be the best, he wants her but Pentecost doesn't think she's ready. And when they try to hook up with their Jaeger, he sees what she's been through, which is what Pentecost was worried about.

Mr. Hobbs wanted the vacation to be a romantic getaway for two, but Peggy insisted that it be a family vacation to a central California beach-side house, given to them for the month by friends. The vacation included all their offspring, and their offspring's respective families where applicable. Hobbs hated the idea as he felt he didn't know his offspring - and their spouses even less - and that they, in turn, no longer needed him. They include: daughter Susan Carver, who, with her husband, Stan Carver, have a permissive parenting style as per the latest child psychology books; daughter Janie Grant, whose husband, college professor, Byron Grant, has an academic view of everything in life; fourteen year old daughter, Katey Hobbs, who is self conscious around boys if only because of her new braces, that self consciousness which boys see as standoffishness; and preteen son Danny Hobbs, whose sole focus in life is watching television. The house ended up being a rat trap which exasperated their cook Brenda the most. But beyond that issue, Mr. Hobbs ended up learning the true nature of his relationship to his offspring and to Peggy. In the process, he had to endure the extended visit by an odd couple named the Turners, and learned that some problems can be solved purely by yelling ""hey Joe"" into an unknown group of boys.

0427224,Eve's Christmas,"It's Christmas Eve, 2004. Eve Simon is a wealthy and successful advertising executive with Bernstein & Barlow on Madison Avenue, but her personal life is less than satisfying. Beyond her assistant Mandy who has been her best friend since grammar school, her married boss and lover, Neil Barlow, is the only other significant person in her personal life. She has not been home to Eastborough, Oregon since she left eight years ago, and rarely speaks to her loving and supportive family there. When Neil tells Eve that he will be spending Christmas with his wife and kids instead of her as was originally planned leaving her alone for Christmas, Eve reflects on her life, most specifically the decision she made eight years ago not to marry her then fianc? and love, Scott Gustafson, who she has not seen or heard of since, but rather accept the internship with Bernstein & Barlow that began the day after Christmas. Christmas was to be the day of her wedding. That decision not to get married was in part because she, despite loving Scott, knew that he would always feel obligated to take over the failing family business, a bookstore, in Eastborough rather than follow her to New York. Making a wish on a Christmas star before she goes to sleep, Eve awakens the next morning transported back in time and place with all the knowledge of her present life to December 19, 1996 in Eastborough, still living at home and preparing for her wedding to Scott. Her sarcastic guardian angel, Brother James, arranged this miracle for her, and is urging her to make what he considers the right decision to marry Scott this second time around. But Eve may fall into the same traps she did the first time around, despite knowing that Neil hired her more for the photograph attached to her resume than for anything else included within it. Regardless of what does happen this second time around, there is no guarantee that it will change her life in 2004. It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas everywhere you go... That is except in the eyes of 33-year-old Eve Simon. She's spending Christmas Eve in a bar pounding back the cocktails. Outside, scenes of happy families and couples walking by arm in arm only deepen Eve's inner depression. A single, successful professional, Eve wonders what material success has brought her. The bar closes early forcing Eve to meander her way through the crowded cheerful streets back to her apartment. Rounding the final corner, Eve bumps into a homeless man, Brother James. As usual, Brother is ranting and raving, this time he's on about the lost holiday spirit. Brother pauses to look the tipsy Eve in the eye. He whispers to her, ""wish upon the Christmas Star."" Eve hands the man some coins and makes her way home. Alone, with no one and nowhere to go, Eve pulls out a photo album she hasn't touched in years. It's filled with pictures of her rural hometown. One photo in particular brings tears to Eve's eyes. It's her at 21 posing with her then-fianc?e, Scott. Eve walked out on Christmas Eve, twelve years ago... the night before their planned Christmas Day wedding. Feeling lonely and upset, Eve seeks solace in the darkness of the winter night. She ventures out on her balcony, where she spies the lone Christmas Star hanging high in the sky. Remembering Brother James, she makes a wish and goes to bed... Will Eve get a second chance? A wealthy and successful career woman gets a second chance in life when a magical wish transports her back in time eight years to when she walked away from her fiance to lead a business life in New York.",4177742|1577038|1112097|1264895|2374486|2994382|0385567|2039366|2064865|0381942|3131532|0413900
1375666,Inception,"Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobb's rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible - inception. Instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one. If they succeed, it could be the perfect crime. But no amount of careful planning or expertise can prepare the team for the dangerous enemy that seems to predict their every move. An enemy that only Cobb could have seen coming. Dominic Cobb is an industrial spy who instead of breaking into a person's home, office, or even computer, gets the information he needs by getting into the person's mind through their dreams. Cobb is also a fugitive who misses his children. Someone approaches Cobb and wants to hire him but instead of getting information out, the man wants Cobb to implant something, a process called 'inception', which is not easy to do. Cobb is hesitant to do it but when the man offers to help Cobb go back to his children, Cobb agrees. So he assembles his team but when they begin, there are things Cobb didn't tell his team that could jeopardize the job and when they occur they're not sure if they should continue. Dominic Cobb is the foremost practitioner of the artistic science of extraction - inserting oneself into a subject's dreams to obtain hidden information without the subject knowing - a concept taught to him by his professor father-in-law, Dr. Stephen Miles. Dom's associates are Miles' former students, who Dom requires as he himself has given up being the dream architect for reasons he won't disclose. Dom's primary associate, Arthur, believes it has something to do with Dom's deceased wife, Mal, who often figures prominently and violently in those dreams, or Dom's want to ""go home"" i.e. get back to his own reality, which includes two young children. Dom's work is generally in corporate espionage. As the subjects don't want the information to get into the wrong hands, the clients have zero tolerance for failure. Dom is also a wanted man as many of his past subjects have learned what Dom has done to them. One of those subjects, Mr. Saito, offers Dom a job he can't refuse: to take the concept one step further into inception, namely planting thoughts into the subject's dreams without them knowing. Inception can fundamentally alter that person as a being. Saito's target is Robert Michael Fischer, the heir to an energy business empire, which has the potential to rule the world if continued on the current trajectory. Beyond the complex logistics of the dream architecture of the case and some unknowns concerning Fischer himself, the biggest obstacles in success for the team become worrying about one aspect of inception which Cobb fails to disclose to the other team members prior to the job, and Cobb's newest associate Ariadne's belief that Cobb's own subconscious, especially as it relates to Mal, may be taking over what happens in the dreams. Corporate espionage. Cobb can invade people's dreams, so corporations hire him to steal business secrets from rivals' subconscious. Saito, an energy magnate, wants Cobb to do the reverse: not take information, but plant an idea in a rival's mind. In return, he'll fix problems with the US government so Cobb can return to his children. Cobb takes the near-impossible job, planning three layers of dreams within dreams for the mark. It requires a larger team taking a powerful sedative: if something goes awry, the dreamers may not awake. Cobb doesn't tell his team that his past nurtures feelings powerful enough to bring on this comatose state for all of them. And the children - are they real? Dom Cobb is able to use his unique skills to his advantage - he can enter people's minds through their dreams and thereby learn their secrets. He is a thief for hire but Japanese businessman Mr. Saito has a somewhat different proposition for him. He wants Cobb to enter the mind of Robert Fischer Jr., who is about to inherit his father's massive business empire, to plant a simple notion: to break-up his father's conglomerate and sell it off. In return, Saito will make it possible for Cobb to freely return to the US where he is currently wanted by the police. Cobb accepts and assembles his team with a plan to plant the idea deep in Fisher's mind by generating a series of dreams within dreams so that he eventually thinks he came up with the idea himself. As the intended deception grows ever more complex, Cobb has to deal with his own emotions and feelings of guilt, which are projecting themselves into the dreamspace. Cobb has to deal with the eventual question of what is real and what is only a dream. A thief who steals corporate secrets through use of the dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a CEO.",0468569|0137523|0109830|0816692|1345836|0133093|0993846|0167260|0120737|1853728|0167261|0114369

She is heading to Streetsville just prior to Thanksgiving as part of her work to schmooze town council to approve the development, not telling her widowed mother, small caf? owner Elaine Gerard, that that is the sole reason for her return home, and that she is planning on going to the Bahamas with two girlfriends instead of staying for Thanksgiving. Mel's Thanksgiving plans are kiboshed when town council delays the vote to after the Thanksgiving weekend to allow all to review the materials for the controversial development, the primary opposition raised by Carter McClure, Mel's high school sweetheart and former fianc?, who, like many of the other townsfolk, believe such a big box will kill local businesses and destroy the small town fabric which is what they love about Streetsville. Carter has even more personal reasons for opposing the development: it will demolish the old inn he and Mel lived in before she moved away, and which he has since repurchased to reconvert into their original dream, a B&B called the Streetsville Inn. After suffering a fall and a possible concussion, Mel awakens with what she believes is her full memory. However instead of what she believes, she is in an alternate life, where she is happily referred to as Melody, came back from Chicago following her father's death eventually to marry Carter, the two who live in what will soon be the opened Streetsville Inn, and she owning and running the caf? called ""Sweet Melody's"". Given this opportunity, Mel will have to decide which life path she wants to take regardless of what is reality, especially as the two worlds start to converge, and what she will need to do to achieve that chosen life path.

0332280,The Notebook,"In a nursing home, resident Duke reads a romance story for an old woman who has senile dementia with memory loss. In the late 1930s, wealthy seventeen year-old Allie Hamilton is spending summer vacation in Seabrook. Local worker Noah Calhoun meets Allie at a carnival and they soon fall in love with each other. One day, Noah brings Allie to an ancient house that he dreams of buying and restoring and they attempt to make love but get interrupted by their friend. Allie's parents do not approve of their romance since Noah belongs to another social class, and they move to New York with her. Noah writes 365 letters (A Year) to Allie, but her mother Anne Hamilton does not deliver them to her daughter. Three years later, the United States joins the World War II and Noah and his best friend Fin enlist in the army, and Allie works as an army nurse. She meets injured soldier Lon Hammond in the hospital. After the war, they meet each other again going on dates and then, Lon, who is wealthy and handsome, proposes. Meanwhile Noah buys and restores the old house and many people want to buy it. When Allie accidentally sees the photo of Noah and his house in a newspaper, she feels divided between her first love and her commitment with Lon. Meanwhile Duke stops reading to the old lady since his children are visiting him in the nursing home. In a care facility, Duke, a resident, has to get permission to read to fellow resident, Ms. Hamilton, on a daily basis, as Ms. Hamilton's health is deteriorating, she who has Alzheimer's. The story is always the same one, which he reads out of his notebook, and which she sometimes remembers that she has heard before, is captivated by but cannot remember how it turns out. It details the love affair between Noah and Allie beginning in 1940 in Seabrook Island, South Carolina, when Allie was seventeen and on the brink of her college life, most-likely at Sarah Lawrence. Their relationship was improbable because of their differing social classes and outlooks which led to their relationship being characterized by constant arguments with each other out of their passion. While Noah was a carefree and working class local who had a 40-cent/hour job at a lumber yard, Allie was from a privileged family, her mother who grew up in Seabrook Island and where they were staying only for the summer. There were many obstacles to a Noah/Allie happy ending, most specifically WWII and her parents, especially her mother, who did not approve of the relationship and did whatever she could to end it. That happy Noah/ Allie ending is not a guarantee due to these obstacles. As the story progresses and as the daily realities of present day occur, the reason why Duke feels the need to tell Ms. Hamilton the story and what he hopes she gets out of it become more and more evident. The movie focuses on an old man reading a story to an old woman in a nursing home. The story he reads follows two young lovers named Allie Hamilton and Noah Calhoun, who meet one evening at a carnival. But they are separated by Allie's parents who disapprove of Noah's unwealthy family, and move Allie away. After waiting for Noah to write her for several years, Allie meets and gets engaged to a handsome young soldier named Lon. Allie, then, with her love for Noah still alive, stops by Noah's 200-year-old home that he restored for her, ""to see if he's okay"". It is evident that they still have feelings for each other, and Allie has to choose between her fianc? and her first love. The movie starts in a nursing home with Duke reading to an older woman, whose memory is slipping from her more and more everyday. Duke reads the story of two lovers who meet in the south at a carnival. Allie was 17. A city girl from money, and Noah was a country boy. The two spend the whole summer together but Allie is forced to move and go to college although she was willing to give it up for Noah. Noah writes Allie 365 letters and she never gets them. So he restores the house him and Allie went to one night out of 'labor of love'. Seven years pass and Allie meets and falls in love with a wealthy soldier Lon. When seeing Noah's picture in the paper, Allie is drawn back to him. They spent a few days together and she doesn't want to leave. Allie has to choose between her fianc? and Noah. An old man in a nursing home reads a story to an old woman each day. The story he reads follows two young lovers named Allie Hamilton and Noah Calhoun. They met one evening at a carnival many years ago. Allie's parents separate Noah and Allie. They disapprove of Noah's lack of wealth, and move Allie away. After waiting for Noah to write her for several years, Allie meets and becomes engaged to a handsome young soldier named Lon. In a local newspaper, Noah's picture catches Allie's eye. He is standing in front of a fully restored, 200-year-old home. The article is filled with praise for his accomplishments. Allie's heart nearly bursts. The last time she saw this house it was a rotted decaying shamble. She stood enfolded in Noah's arms in the great entryway and listened to his plans to buy and restore this house. Just the way she wanted it. With her love for Noah still alive, the picture pulls at her heart. She has to go back, see if Noah is okay, and tell him about her marriage. They both think the echo deep in their hearts, the one that has lasted all these years, is not shared by the other. The cry they could not stifle. It wasn't over for me.

1024648,Argo,"In 1979, the American embassy in Iran was invaded by Iranian revolutionaries and several Americans were taken hostage. However, six managed to escape to the official residence of the Canadian Ambassador and the CIA was ordered to get them out of the country. With few options, exfiltration expert Tony Mendez devised a daring plan: create a phony Canadian film project looking to shoot in Iran and smuggle the Americans out as its production crew. With the help of some trusted Hollywood contacts, Mendez created the ruse and proceeded to Iran as its associate producer. However, time was running out with the Iranian security forces closing in on the truth while both his charges and the White House had grave doubts about the operation themselves. After Iranian militants stormed and took control of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in November 1979 taking 56 Americans as hostages, six Americans managed to get away and took refuge in the home of Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor. After two months of the Canadians putting their lives on the line everyday, the CIA and the US State Department try to come up with a plan to get their people out. Tony Mendez is an ""ex filtration"" specialist who proposes that they pose as a Canadian film crew scouting locations for a science fiction movie called Argo. Using Hollywood connections, Mendez creates a back story for the movie - ads in Variety, casting calls, inviting he media to a production launch - and then heads off to Iran to lead the six Americans out. In 1979, the US Embassy in Iran is stormed by protesters who then take everyone there captive. But 6 members manage to get out and go to the Canadian embassy. After a few months, the 6 are still there. And it's only a matter of time before the Iranians discover that 6 members of the embassy staff are missing. So the CIA must find a way to get them out. And so far they can't come up with a way. Tony Mendez, an ex filtration expert comes up with a plan. He will go in as a producer scouting for shooting locations for a movie and that the 6 are part of the production crew. So he goes to Hollywood and with help from a friend, makes it appear that he is a producer. And the movie they're producing is called Argo. Eventually he goes to Iran to tell them what they have to do. In late 1979, anti-American sentiments are running high in Iran due to the US harboring the ailing former Shah of Iran, who the US put into place in the 1950s, and who many Iranians saw as causing much hardship and death for residents over his close to thirty year reign, solely for his and his family's own benefit. In November, Iranian militants, working under the name of its new leader, the In 1979, the Islamic Revolution overthrows the dictator Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who came to power sponsored by the United States government, and the leader of the revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, assumes the power.

However, six officials flee from the Embassy and are secretly hosted by the Canadian Ambassador at his residence in Tehran and the CIA directors summon the agent Tony Mendez, who is an expert in bringing American citizens back to their country, to plot a rescue plan to save the group. Tony Mendez plots the most incredible plan to bring the six officials: to create a fake Canadian film to be shot in Iran and include the officials in the production crew. Without other alternative, Tony Mendez receives green light from his superiors and travels to Hollywood to set in motion his almost impossible mission to rescue the group. Acting under the cover of a Hollywood producer scouting a location for a science fiction film, a CIA agent launches a dangerous operation to rescue six Americans in Tehran during the U.S. hostage crisis in Iran in 1980.",0887912|1010048|1504320|2024544|0454876|0405159|1655442|1285016|0375679|2562232|0947798|1045658

Andrea dreams to become a journalist and faces the opportunity as a temporary professional challenge. The first assistant Emily advises Andrea about the behavior and preferences of their cruel boss, and the stylist Nigel helps Andrea to dress more adequately for the environment. Andrea changes her attitude and behavior, affecting her private life and the relationship with her boyfriend Nate, her family and friends. In the end, Andrea learns that life is made of choices.

0109830,Forrest Gump,"Forrest Gump is a simple man with a low I.Q. but good intentions. He is running through childhood with his best and only friend Jenny. His 'mama' teaches him the ways of life and leaves him to choose his destiny. Forrest joins the army for service in Vietnam, finding new friends called Dan and Bubba, he wins medals, creates a famous shrimp fishing fleet, inspires people to jog, starts a ping-pong craze, creates the smiley, writes bumper stickers and songs, donates to people and meets the president several times. However, this is all irrelevant to Forrest who can only think of his childhood sweetheart Jenny Curran, who has messed up her life. Although in the end all he wants to prove is that anyone can love anyone. The movie Forrest Gump follows the life events of a man who shares the name as the title of the film. Gump faces many tribulations throughout his life, but he never lets any of them interfere with his happiness. From wearing braces on his legs, to having a below average IQ and even being shot, Gump continues to believe that good things will happen and goes after his dreams. While several less than ideal things occur during Gump's life, he manages to turn each setback into something good for him, such as when he finally gets his braces off he discovers that he is capable of running faster than most other people. This skill allows Gump to not only escape his bullies while he is a child in Greenbow, but also to gain a football scholarship, save many soldiers' lives and become famous for his ability. While Gump eventually achieves the majority of the things he hoped to throughout the movie, it proved a much more difficult task to win the heart of his life-long friend Jenny Curran. The movie is centered on Forrest Gump and the incidences that occur during his life, but during each period in his lifetime he thinks back of Jenny and how important she is to him. Although the two characters grew up together and shared a very close friendship, as the movie progresses they grow apart. This upsets Gump who cares immensely for the girl who had a rough start in life, and it seems the two always end up back in each other's lives, often in extraordinary ways like meeting in the Reflection Pond in D.C. Even though Gump is the main character of the film, it similarly tells the story of Curran and the hardships she faces. ""Stupid is as stupid does"" is what Forrest Gump hears throughout his less than picturesque childhood. Though not as smart as the people he meets along the way, Forrest is thrust into some scary, crazy and downright incredible situations, rubbing shoulders with some great historical figures and escaping many dangers on sheer dumb luck. His giant heart and never fading love for his lifelong friend Jenny take him on a journey where he learns what his destiny is. A simple-minded but kind-hearted Alabama boy grows up with his best friend - a beautiful girl called Jenny. He succeeds in life through a mixture of luck and destiny and thus influences and is present at some of the most important events in the second half of the 20th century. Throughout his life he is told by other characters what life is about and whether it's all random or destined to happen, but he comes to his own conclusion towards the end. A man with a low I.Q. has accomplished great things in his life and been present during significant historic events - in each case, far exceeding what anyone imagined he could do. Yet, despite all the things he has attained, his one true love eludes him. ""Forrest Gump"" is the story of a man who rose above his challenges, and who proved that determination, courage, and love are more important than ability. Forrest Gump, while not intelligent, has accidentally been present at many historic moments, but his true love, Jenny Curran, eludes him.",0137523|1375666|0110912|0167260|0111161|0120689|0114369|0167261|0102926|0120737|0133093|0172495

However, in his despair, a jackalope passes by and shows the forlornly shorn sheep he can still dance even his present state to maintain his own sense of self worth during difficult times.

0041598,Long-Haired Hare,"Opera star Giovanni Jones is trying to rehearse but Bugs is singing another tune while playing his banjo, then his harp, then his tuba. Jones destroys the instruments over Bugs' head, and, of course, ""this means war."" Revenge takes place when Bugs, as white-maned ""Leopold"", conducts Jones' Hollywood Bowl concert. Bugs loves music. He's just out in the meadow, minding his own business, playing ""A Rainy Night in Rio"" on his banjo like any other fun-loving rabbit. But who should come outside but the great big pompous opera star, Giovanni Jones, needing quiet for his own rehearsal. After Jones smashes Bugs's banjo over his furry head, Bugs shrugs it off. ""Music-hater,"" he concludes. He shrugs off the next attack with, ""Rabbit-hater."" The third attack? ""Of course you know, this means war."" Later, during the star's performance at the Hollywood Bowl, Bugs sneaks in and finds devious uses for alum; a mallet; a bobby-soxer disguise; a pen that looks suspiciously like a stick of dynamite; and finally a long-haired white wig that will convince everyone he's Leopold Stokowski. The great ""Leopold"" will demand a performance from Jones that he'll never forget. World-famous opera singer Giovanni Jones is trying to rehearse for his upcoming concert. However, Bugs Bunny's singing bothers Giovanni, who's trying to concentrate. But instead of asking Bugs -- who had been minding his own business -- to desist stop until the rehearsal ended, the ill-tempered Giovanni destroys the bunny's instruments as a banjo and harp (and injures Bugs in the process). Bugs eventually has had enough and gets his revenge ... during Giovanni's concert at the Hollywood Bowl. After using a variety of means to soften the opera singer up, Bugs pulls out the coup de gras: dressed as world-renowned conductor Leopold, the bunny makes Giovanni sing an insipid song (basically to make him look foolish) before forcing him to hold a high note, which causes the amphitheater to crumble on top on the singer. But Bugs (who has since ordered earmuffs, rush-delivered thanks to some very express delivery) isn't through yet: ""Leopold"" --having spotted a huge boulder teetering perilously above where Giovanni is standing -- gets the singer to blare out his high note once more. The boulder tips over and crushes Giovanni. Bugs' banjo solo ""Good Evening, Folks"" ties up the bunny's satisfying revenge (and the cartoon). Bugs Bunny retaliates against the pompous opera star who does him violence.",0038333|0041462|0045585|0045315|0045062|0042928|0040625|0043479|0042871|0043315|0038586|0043128

Magneto, who believes a war is approaching, has an evil plan in mind, and needs young Rogue to help him. A band of unique power-possessing mutants live in a world where their kind is hated and persecuted by humans. Under the guidance of their leader, Professor Charles Xavier, the X-Men strive for a world where humans and mutants can peacefully co-exist. The superheroes must also combat those radical mutants with intentions of exterminating human the race. In the near future, when children are being born with a special X-factor in their genes, giving them special powers and making them mutants, the seeds of a new Holocaust are being sown by Senator Robert Kelly. The situation brings into opposition the fellow mutants and former friends, Erik Lehnsherr, a.k.a. Magneto, and Professor Charles Xavier. While Xavier wants a peaceful means of stopping the hatred toward mutants, Magneto seeks to even things out with a machine that would speed up the mutation process in all humans, making everyone equal. To stop Magneto, Xavier brings together a special group of mutants called ""X-Men"" to stop him. In the meantime, two mysterious mutants emerge: Logan, a powerful and aggressive mutant with no past, no memories, and a young girl named Rogue.

When a new sergeant, James, takes over a highly trained bomb disposal team amidst violent conflict, he surprises his two subordinates, Sanborn and Eldridge, by recklessly plunging them into a deadly game of urban combat, behaving as if he's indifferent to death. As the men struggle to control their wild new leader, the city explodes into chaos, and James' true character reveals itself in a way that will change each man forever. When SFC William James joins Bravo Company in Iraq, they have a month or so left in their tour of duty. He's a bomb disposal expert sent to replace Sgt. Matt Thompson, a long-standing member of the team recently killed while disposing of an improvised explosive device. To say that James loves what he does doesn't quite capture the emotional high he experiences when he gets to do what he does best. His fellow squad members (Sgt. JT Sanborn and Spc. Owen Eldridge) just want to survive the few days of duty they have left, but James' risk-taking drives them all to the edge. The Bravo Company's bomb disposal unit, currently stationed in Baghdad, comprises US Army Sergeant First Class Will James, Sergeant JT Sanborn, and Specialist Owen Eldridge. James, the new tech team leader, arrives on the scene when Bravo Company has just thirty-nine days left on its current deployment. It will be a long thirty-nine days for Sanborn and Eldridge, whose styles do not mesh with their new leader (a renegade for whom the thrill of the dismantlement seems to be the ultimate goal, regardless of safety for his fellow team members, for others on the scene, or for himself). By contrast, Sanborn is all by the books, knowing his place and duty and trusting others in the army to carry out their assignments just as well as he does. Eldridge, on the other hand, is an insecure soldier constantly worried that an error or misjudgment on his part will lead to the death of an innocent civilian or a military colleague. While the three members face their own internal issues, they have to be aware of any person at the bomb sites, some of whom may be bombers themselves. During the Iraq War, a Sergeant recently assigned to an army bomb squad is put at odds with his squad mates due to his maverick way of handling his work.",1024648|1010048|0375679|1504320|1655442|0405159|1285016|0477348|2024544|0265086|0095953|0407887

1285016,The Social Network,"On a fall night in 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg sits down at his computer and heatedly begins working on a new idea. In a fury of blogging and programming, what begins in his dorm room soon becomes a global social network and a revolution in communication. A mere six years and 500 million friends later, Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history... but for this entrepreneur, success leads to both personal and legal complications. Every age has its visionaries who leave, in the wake of their genius, a changed world--but rarely without a battle over exactly what happened and who was there at the moment of creation. ""The Social Network"" explores the moment at which Facebook was invented--through the warring perspectives of the super-smart young men who each claimed to be there at its inception. The movie moves from the halls of Harvard to the cubicles of Palo Alto to capture the heady early days of a culture-changing phenomenon in the making--and the way it both pulled a group of young revolutionaries together and then split them apart. In the midst of the chaos are Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), the brilliant Harvard student who conceived a Web site; Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), once Zuckerberg's close friend, who provided the seed money for the fledgling company; Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), who brought Facebook to Silicon Valley's venture capitalists; and the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence), the Harvard classmates who asserted that Zuckerberg stole their idea and then sued him for ownership of it. Each has his own narrative, his own version of the Facebook story in this multi-level portrait of 21st Century success--both the youthful fantasy of it and its finite realities as well. As told through flashbacks via deposition hearings for two concurrent lawsuits, the development and early days of the social networking website Facebook is presented. Harvard students Not very good at expressing himself in person, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) first alienates himself from his girlfriend, who feels conversing with him is like working the 'stairmaster', while taking strong exception to his condescending remarks towards her. He and his buddy, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), plagiarize a proposed networking website from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, made exclusively for Harvadites - re-naming it 'The Facebook'. This site connects students, describes what drives life in college, who's single, and how to hook-up with girls. Both then are approached by Napster-fame Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), and upon his advise, 'The' is removed - giving birth to the now-revolutionary 'Facebook' - that can be accessed by anyone worldwide - not just a few exclusive campuses. But his competitiveness, inability to communicate, and the urge to be number one, will alienate him, and result in two lawsuits - one from the Winklevoss twins - and the second from none other than Eduardo himself. The story of the creators of Facebook and the subsequent legal battles that stretched out over several years. Told mostly in flashbacks while Mark Zuckerman gives depositions in two lawsuits, the idea of a shareable social information site came to him one night after he hacked into his school's database and published the photos of all the women at the school. One of his roommates, Eduardo Saverin, provides the upfront financing and Zuckerman deftly outmaneuvers two other students who had a similar idea. The relationship with Saverin deteriorates and he soon finding himself on the outside looking in. All in all, an unflattering picture of all those involved.

America's most well-known little terror, Dennis the Menace, gets into numerous scrapes and adventures with his dog Ruff and his friends Joey and Margaret. This typically involves some means of tormenting Dennis's hapless next-door neighbor, Mr. Wilson. The 1980s animated version of the classic comic strip, created by cartoonist Hank Ketcham. Dennis Mitchell was an adorable, blond-haired and freckle-faced boy who had one fault: His penchant for mischief, much more so by nature than by definition, though all his long-suffering parents, Henry and Alice, could do was shake their heads and try to explain their son to others. Dennis' curiosity, escapades and well-meaning ways usually led to trouble; usually on the receiving end was the lad's neighbor, George Wilson. The gruff Mr. Wilson (a retired postal carrier) just wanted to be left alone and was constantly frustrated by Dennis' frequent visits and well-meaning ways; all he wanted to do was be left alone and enjoy peace and quiet. His wife, Martha, on the other hand, adored Dennis and saw him as a surrogate grandson. Stories centered on Dennis' adventures with his friends, among which included Joey and Margaret; his faithful canine companion, Ruff; and the oftentimes less-than-willing Mr. Wilson. Several adventures also involved criminals, who were often begging to be arrested once Dennis got through with them. Though generally considered to be 5 years old in the comic strip, the stories presented in this ""Dennis the Meance"" series seem to indicate Dennis is several years older, perhaps 9 or 10 years old.",0285371|0173556|0103373|0085033|0289036|0190178|0103408|0149545|0081933|0386986|0055683|0053502

0131704,The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle,"35 years after The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show's cancellation, our two TV heroes have been living off the finances of their reruns on TV. To make matters worse, Rocky has lost his ability to fly, and the trees in Frostbite Falls have all been cut down. Meanwhile, over in Pottsylvania, home of Rocky and Bullwinkle's arch enemies Fearless Leader, Boris, and Natasha, the Iron Curtain has fallen, leading the villains to leave Pottsylvania, and dig through a tunnel all the way to the TV of a Hollywood Producer, Minnie Mogul. She signs a contract, giving her the rights to produce the Rocky and Bullwinkle Movie, and accidentally pulls the three villains out of the TV, turning them into humans! Now, they have an evil plan to hypnotize America, using RBTV (Really Bad TeleVision), making everyone's mind mush, so he can go on to the TV, and get everyone to vote him President of the USA! However, new FBI Agent Karen Sympathy has an assignment--get the only ones who could ever defeat the villains- Rocky and Bullwinkle. Using a green light lighthouse, Rocky and Bullwinkle (and their Narrator) are sucked out of the TV world, and to real life as 3D computer-generated characters! With all of America being hypnotized, and Fearless Leader's evil speech in 48 hours, and Boris and Natasha giving chase, planning to use a computer laser to send destroy moose and squirrel, it's Rocky, Bullwinkle, and Karen on a hilarious, pun-filled, and cameo-filled adventure to New York by plane, car, truck, hoof, flying squirrel, and yes, e-mail, to stop Fearless Leader and save America! In 1964 the Rocky and Bullwinkle Show went off air and life became very depressing for Bullwinkle J. Moose and Rocket J. Squirrel. Their home Frostbite Falls had become crippled by years of re-runs, the forests are in deforestation and the once majestic falls now a sludge waterfall. In Pottsylvania, Fearless Leader, Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale are having tough times too when the Iron Curtain collapses on them and the citizens of the country become free. However, Fearless Leader comes up with a daring plan and he and his minions dig all the way to Los Angeles. Then in a film studio, they meet with Minnie Mogul, who is looking for a not-so intelligent film script which she can make as her own. From within a television set, the villains convince her to produce the ""Rocky and Bullwinkle Movie"" by signing a contract which will give her all rights to the old show. She signs the contract, and then pulls it out of the television, bringing the villains with it and turning them into live-action stars. The villains claim they came because they were ""attached to the project."" Now, they have an evil plan to ultimately hypnotize America, using RBTV, which stands for ""Really Bad Television"" making everyone's mind mush, so he can go on to the TV, and get everyone to vote him as President of the USA! Meanwhile Rocky and Bullwinkle are sucked out of the TV world, and turned into real life as 3D computer-generated characters!

Boris and Natasha somehow manage to crossover into reality and team up with Fearless Leader, an evil criminal turned media mogul with some evil plans up his sleeve.

0051189,"What's Opera, Doc?","""What's Opera, Doc?"" lampoons classic opera by using its elements to set up the latest chapter in Elmer Fudd's hapless pursuit of Bugs Bunny. We open with a silhouette of a mighty Viking arousing ferocious lightning storms ... only to find it's Elmer -- this time as the demigod Siegfried. Elmer admonishes the audience (in classical verse) to ""be vewwy quiet, I'm hunting wabbits!"" It's not long before Elmer comes upon Bugs' hole and sings out ""Kill the wabbit!"" not realizing that the hare has already climbed out and is viewing Elmer spearing fruitlessly in said hole. Bugs joins in the fun, querying his tagline in operatic verse and leaving Elmer in his dust (but not before ""Siegfried"" shows us an example of supposed ""mighty powers"" from his spear and magic helmet). Elmer goes after the wascally wabbit, but his pursuit is ended when he sets his eyes on the stunningly and awesomely beautiful Valkyrie Brunhilde (Bugs in disguise). After a ""hard-to-get"" pursuit"" (brought on by Elmer's eternally-misguided hormones) ""Siegfried"" and ""Valkyrie"" join in magnificent duet with ""Return My Love."" However, Bugs' scheme is exposed when his headdress falls off, enraging Elmer. The pseudo-Viking commands fierce lightning, rain, hail and wind storms (not to mention smog) to ""kill the wabbit!"" It works, but upon seeing the bunny's corpse, a woefully remorseful Elmer is reduced to tears as he somberly carries the ""dead"" Bugs into the distance. But has Bugs really been struck dead? Elmer Fudd is again hunting rabbits - only this time it's an opera. Wagner's Siegfried with Elmer as the titular hero and Bugs as Brunnhilde. They sing, they dance, they eat the scenery.",0045708|0042871|0048449|0045709|0043953|0045062|0052139|0045710|0042928|0041598|0044609|0030604

0109162,Asterix in America,"Caesar has had enough when another legion is hacked to pieces by the damned single indomitable village in Gaul because of the druid's magic potion, so he decides to tackle the problem at the root before conspiratorial senators exploit his humiliation: sycophant Lucullus is ordered to capture the druid (believed immortal) and push him over the edge of the earth (according to the story still believed to be flat as a pizza; actually Greeks and Romans knew better). By pure luck, Lucullus' first net traps both druid and Obelix's pet dog, so the giant and Asterix follow them by ship on the Atlantic, and crash after a storm on the North America coast in pursuit of the druid who was catapulted off the Roman galley before Lucullus triumphantly sets sails back for Europe. They find the druid and meet a tribe of Indians (believing to be in India), literally a whole New World for the equally primitive Celts. At the home front, Caesar sees his chance to overrun the village, but has to wait till the last magic potion has run out, hoping the heroes won't return. In America, the medicine man has a bad eye in the foreigners, especially when the druid proves a dangerous rival... During a brawl in their Gallic village, the magic potion that gives the heroes ASTERIX and OBELIX their superhuman power tips over. But now After another spectacular defeat of a fresh centurion Caesar sends Lucullus, one of his sycophants, to try to capture Getafix and throw him off the edge of the world away from prying eyes in case things go badly. Then so Asterix and Obelix ventures to America to rescue a magical Druid. Before the druid Getafix can make another brew, the Romans capture him and catapult him into space from their galley at the edge of the word. They believe that the earth is flat!

She is preparing to move her family out of the field they live in as plowing time approaches, however her son Timothy has fallen ill, and moving him could prove fatal. Mrs. Brisby visits The Great Owl, a wise creature who advises her to visit a mysterious group of rats who live beneath a rose bush on the farm. Upon visiting the rats, Brisby meets Nicodemus, the wise and mystical leader of the rats, and Justin, a friendly rat who immediately becomes attached to Mrs. Brisby. While there, she learns that her late husband, Mr. Jonathon Brisby, along with the rats, was a part of a series of experiments at a place known only as N.I.M.H. (revealed earlier in the story as the National Institute of Mental Health). The experiments performed on the mice and rats there boosted their intelligence, allowing them to read without being taught and to understand things such as complex mechanics and electricity. The rats and Mr. Brisby escaped from N.I.M.H. and came to live on the Fitzgibbon farm. The rats created a home for themselves under Mrs. Fitzgibbon's rose bush, creating an elaborate habitation of beautiful chambers, elevators, and Christmas lights. However, the rats are unhappy in their dependence on the humans, who they are stealing electricity from, and have concocted a plan to leave the farm and live independently. Because of her husband's prior relationship with the rats, they agree to help Mrs. Brisby move her home out of the path of the plow. However, the evil Jenner and his unwilling accomplice Sullivan, who wish to remain beneath the rose bush, yet plot to kill Nicodemus during the move. It seems to Mrs. Brisby, the widowed head of a family of field mice, that her youngest son must die, either by the farmer's spring plough or of pneumonia in his flight to safety. In her quest for a cure she frees a young crow from some string in which he has foolishly tied himself, at the mercy of the farmer's cat Dragon. In return for her risking her life to save his, he takes her to the creature all birds know is the wisest: a great owl. Owls eat mice, but when this owl learns Mrs. Brisby's name he sets her on a path to earning a noble solution to her predicament - which is the secret of NIMH... A fieldmouse named Mrs. Brisby must move her family to a safe location before the farmer plows the field where they live, but her invalid son Timmy cannot go outside due to his pneumonia. She enlists the aid of some highly intelligent, escaped lab rats that have built a subterranean society inside a rose bush near the farmer's garden. The rats, led by the wise Nicodemus, decide to help her physically move her house to repay a debt of gratitude to her late husband, who made possible the rats' escape from the laboratory. But things become complicated when some of the rats decide to use the situation to kill Nicodemus and make it appear to be accidental. To save her ill son, a field mouse must seek the aid of a colony of rats, with whom she has a deeper link than she ever suspected.",0090633|0096787|0095489|0101329|0104254|0083791|0102802|0084237|0076618|0111419|0091149|0114108
0048449,One Froggy Evening,"A workman finds a singing frog in the cornerstone of an old building being demolished. But when he tries to cash in on his discovery, he finds the frog will sing only for him, and just croak for the talent agent and the audience in the theater he's spent his life savings on. A construction worker is part of a demolition crew, tearing down an old city building to make way for new construction. In the cornerstone he discovers an old, tattered box. When opened, out jumps a sad- and unimpressive-looking bullfrog. Unimpressive, that is, until he reaches for his cane and top hat and belts out the tune, ""Hello! Ma Baby."" The construction worker instantly deduces that this frog is his way out of the blue-collared lifestyle and into fabulous wealth. The man tells a stern-looking talent agent about his ""discovery,"" but the frog only croaks (literally); it seems as though the frog will only perform for the construction worker and only when it's a one-man audience. Undaunted and still not coming to this realization, the man squanders his life's savings on the purchase of a theater, where he tries to get the frog to sing again. The frog does perform ... behind the jammed curtain, that is. By the time the man gets the curtain unjammed, the frog reverts to his sad-looking, croaking self, leaving his master to deal with an angry audience. Several months pass, and the man is now reduced to sleeping on park benches. The frog's singing disturbs the peace, and a policeman takes the hapless gent into custody. He ends up in a mental institution, where (you guessed it) the frog sings. The man, later released from the hospital, ends up discarding the frog and his box into the cornerstone of a new skyscraper. Fast forward to 100 years later, where that building is now being torn down. A member of the crew disintegrating the building (by use of laser guns) finds the singing frog, who goes into the same old song and dance. The cycle continues! A man futilely struggles to make his fortune with a frog that sings and dances, but only when it is alone with the owner.",0045708|0051189|0042871|0045709|0043953|0045062|0045710|0042928|0052139|0044609|0030604|0038586

1798709,Her,"Theodore is a lonely man in the final stages of his divorce. When he's not working as a letter writer, his down time is spent playing video games and occasionally hanging out with friends. He decides to purchase the new OS1, which is advertised as the world's first artificially intelligent operating system, ""It's not just an operating system, it's a consciousness,"" the ad states. Theodore quickly finds himself drawn in with Samantha, the voice behind his OS1. As they start spending time together they grow closer and closer and eventually find themselves in love. Having fallen in love with his OS, Theodore finds himself dealing with feelings of both great joy and doubt. As an OS, Samantha has powerful intelligence that she uses to help Theodore in ways others hadn't, but how does she help him deal with his inner conflict of being in love with an OS? In today's world, much is accomplished through the use of computer systems which use voice recognition, those computer systems which in turn communicate to their user often through a generated voice. Theodore Twombly, who works as a writer of computer-generated handwritten letters for clients, is an introverted man on the verge of divorce from his long time love, Catherine. He is hanging onto his marriage for dear life. Beyond his purely platonic relationship with a longtime friend, the married Amy, Theodore is having problems moving onto other satisfying female relationships, either romantically or even sexually. He eventually realizes he is falling for his confidante who has become possibly his best friend, Samantha, the name he has given to the artificial intelligence operating system that powers all his personal technological devices. As Samantha is designed to cater to Theodore's needs, she evolves to a point of falling for him as well. Beyond the fact that Samantha does not have a body, they have to come up with ways of making the relationship into one truly fulfilling in every component. Three of the many questions that may arise are whether Theodore's relationship with Samantha is preventing him from having a more satisfying relationship with a female human, whether a human and a computer operating system truly can be bonded in all critical aspects, and whether Samantha's quick evolution means she will evolve even further to her own form of self-fulfillment. In a near future, lonely Theodore works writing beautiful handwritten letters in a company, and is divorcing from his wife Catherine. In his leisure time, he usually recalls the good moments of his life with Catherine and likes to play a new videogame. His best friend is his neighbor Amy, who is married to Charles. One day, Theodore sees the advertisement of a new operating system called OS-1 that is announced as the first artificially intelligent operating system and he decides to buy it. After the installation, he has a conversation with a seductive female voice and when he asks her name, she tells that she is Samantha. Soon Samantha develops her feelings and they fall in love with each other. The insecure Theodore feels divided for loving a computer system while Samantha does not stop to grow-up and evolve. Sensitive letter writer Theodore has just ended his marriage. Lonely, he goes out to buy an artificially intelligent Operating System that promises to give him everything he needs. Samantha is more than his average OS. She does secretarial work for him but also becomes his friend whenever he's lonely. They go out on adventures and travel together. He becomes the physical feet to get them places, and she the new eyes in which to see the world. Their intimate moments soon turn into love and they start an unusual relationship between OS and human. Things get complicated as they deal with Theodore's complex emotions and Samantha's inability to provide physical comfort. What happens to an OS when its consciousness is altered?

0056956,The Courtship of Eddie's Father,"Eddie thinks it is time for his father to remarry. However, in his opinion his father's taste in women leaves much to be desired. He believes the girl next door would be a far better choice... Following the death of his wife Helen, Tom Corbett needs to adjust to a new bachelor life with his young son Eddie. Although they both dearly miss Helen, Tom and Eddie would like another woman to enter their lives as wife and mother. One woman already in their lives is Elizabeth Martin, a volunteer nurse, divorc?e and Helen's best friend who lives next door. Tom and Elizabeth like each other as friends, as do Eddie and Elizabeth, but Tom and Elizabeth are constantly bickering and place walls up between each other in developing anything more serious. The first new woman to enter their lives does so for more pragmatic reasons - Tom hires a housekeeper, Mrs. Livingston, to tend to the domestic duties in the household. The second woman to enter their lives is Dolly Daily, a naive but attractive young woman from small town America who is in the big city solely to build up her self-confidence. Tom feels more protective toward Dolly than anything, and a business meeting Tom sets up between Dolly and Tom's womanizing colleague, Norman Jones, leads to a romance and ultimate marriage between the two. And the third woman to enter their lives is Rita Behrens, a chic fashion consultant. Tom and Rita immediately hit it off, but Eddie shows open disdain for Rita, solely because she has squinty eyes like all the ""bad"" girls in the comic books. Tom and Eddie have a falling out because of what Tom sees as Eddie's irrational dislike for Rita. After a courtship, Tom asks Rita to marry him, an act that sparks two responses. Rita, noticing Eddie's disdain for her, wants to send him away during the beginning of the marriage just to give it a chance of success without the added pressure of Eddie's judgment. And Eddie runs away from Tom into the safe and caring arms of Elizabeth, who he would really like to see as his new mother. Both responses show Tom that marriage to Rita would not work, and that perhaps the walls he and Elizabeth have placed between themselves really are what need to come down for both the Corbett household and Elizabeth to be truly happy.",0063887|0057999|0063821|0054188|0063829|0039111|0046617|0058230|0051745|0055124|0042327|0053271
0947798,Black Swan,"Nina (Portman) is a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life, like all those in her profession, is completely consumed with dance. She lives with her obsessive former ballerina mother Erica (Hershey) who exerts a suffocating control over her. When artistic director Thomas Leroy (Cassel) decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Ryder) for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily (Kunis), who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side - a recklessness that threatens to destroy her. Thomas Leroy, the artistic director of a New York City ballet company, is mounting Swan Lake as the company's next production. Many of the ballerinas in the company aspire for the lead, which would have previously gone to the company's former principle dancer Beth Macintyre before her forced retirement. No one wants the the role more than Nina Sayers, who lives to dance, so much so that she wants to be exactly like Beth in every aspect. Nina lives with her overbearing mother, Erica Sayers, a former ballerina who now lives vicariously through her daughter as she never made it as a ballerina herself. Nina is a technically proficient and hard working dancer who can easily capture the essence of the innocent white swan, but Thomas doesn't believe she has the dark passion required to portray the black swan. An unexpected move by Nina convinces Thomas that Nina may have what it takes, and he gives her the lead. Thomas will do anything to get that passion out of her. Nina feels that her new place in the company is threatened by Lily, a ballerina newly arrived into the company from San Francisco. Lily, who is looser in every aspect of her life than Nina, encompasses the essence of the black swan more so than Nina. But as Nina believes Lily is to her what she herself was to Beth, Nina, in doing whatever it takes to be perfect as both the white swan and the black swan, descends into madness. Nina Sayers is a dancers with a New York City ballet company. She is dedicated to her art and her craft but lacks confidence. She is also pressed on by her domineering mother, also a ballerina in her youth, who gave up dancing when she got pregnant with Nina. Nina seems to achieve her goal when the company's artistic director Thomas Leroy selects her as the lead in their new production of Swan Lake. Leroy is honest however in telling her that while he has no doubt she can handle the role of the white swan, he's not sure she can handle the role of the black swan. Adding to her self-doubts is the arrival of a new dancer, Lily, who seems ideally suited to playing the black swan. To succeed, Nina will will have to transform herself into something she has never been. A committed dancer wins the lead role in a production of Tchaikovsky's ""Swan Lake"" only to find herself struggling to maintain her sanity.",1285016|1010048|0454876|1454468|1045658|0499549|1798709|1504320|0421715|0467406|1024648|0790636

Before his death, the Emperor chooses Maximus to be his heir over his own son, Commodus, and a power struggle leaves Maximus and his family condemned to death. The powerful general is unable to save his family, and his loss of will allows him to get captured and put into the Gladiator games until he dies. The only desire that fuels him now is the chance to rise to the top so that he will be able to look into the eyes of the man who will feel his revenge. In Gladiator, victorious general Maximus Decimus Meridias has been named keeper of Rome and its empire by dying emperor Marcus Aurelius, so that rule might pass from the Caesars back to the people and Senate. Marcus' neglected and power-hungry son, Commodus, has other ideas, however. Escaping an ordered execution, Maximus hurries back to his home in Spain, too late to save his wife and son from the same order. Taken into slavery and trained as a gladiator by Proximo, Maximus lives only that he might someday take his revenge and fulfill the dying wish of his emperor. The time soon comes when Proximo's troupe is called to Rome to participate in a marathon of gladiator games held at the behest of the new emperor, Commodus. Once in Rome, Maximus wastes no time in making his presence known, and is soon involved in a plot to overthrow the emperor with his former-love Lucilla, Commodus' sister, after whom he lusts, and also the widowed mother of Lucius, heir to the empire after his uncle, and democratic-minded senator, Gracchus. Upon the sudden death of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius, his trusted and successful general Maximus Meridas is unlawfully imprisoned and condemned to the gladiator games by Marcus' twisted son Commodus. As the new emperor, Commodus fears Maximus could use his heroic stature to depose him and become leader himself. But Maximus gains fame as a gladiator and uses his celebrity to cause further damage to Commodus' tenuous hold on the susceptible Roman people, hoping to inspire them to rediscover their lost values and overcome the corruption that is eating away at them. These actions prompt Commodus to square off mano a mano with Maximus in the Colisseum with the fate of Rome at stake. A dying Marcus Aurelius plans to name his loyal and brave General Maximus as his successor in order to restore the power of the Roman Senate. However, his power-hungry, jealous son Commodus learns of the plan, murders Marcus Aurelius, and plans to execute Maximus in order to secure his claim to the throne. Maximus escapes execution, but is sold into slavery and is forced to become a gladiator. Eventually, Maximus and his fellow gladiators are sent to Rome to perform for Commodus. Through his bravery he wins over the masses and reveals his true identity, much to the chagrin of Commodus. Can Maximus use his newfound popularity to avenge Marcus Aurelius' death, or will Commodus be able to keep the throne? When a Roman general is betrayed and his family murdered by an emperor's corrupt son, he comes to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge.",0112573|0120815|0109830|0167261|0120689|0167260|0133093|0120737|0114369|0137523|1375666|0102926

0790636,Dallas Buyers Club,"Dallas 1985. Electrician and sometimes rodeo bull rider Ron Woodroof lives hard, which includes heavy smoking, drinking, drug use (primarily cocaine) and casual sex. He is racist and homophobic. While in the hospital on a work related injury, the doctors discover and inform him that he is HIV+, and that he will most-likely die within thirty days. Ron is initially in angry denial that he would have a disease that only ""faggots"" have, but upon quick reflection comes to the realization that the diagnosis is probably true. He begins to read whatever research is available about the disease, which at this time seems to be most effectively treated by the drug AZT. AZT, however, is only in the clinical trials stage within the US. Incredulous that he, as a dying man, cannot pay for any drug which may save or at least prolong his life, he goes searching for it by whatever means possible. It eventually leads him to Mexico and a ""Dr."" Vass, an American physician whose license was revoked in the US because of his AIDS related work against US regulations. Dr. Vass leads Ron to a cocktail of other drugs, some vitamins, he believes are more effective in treating the symptoms, since the virus, as Ron learns, will always be in the system of those who have been exposed to it. Ron begins to smuggle these drugs not approved by the FDA into the US, not only for his own use but for sale to other HIV+ persons. In this venture, he goes into an unlikely partnership with a HIV+ transgender woman named Rayon, who he met in the hospital and who has greater contact with AIDS patients through the gay community. As they try to work both above ground to get the meds to those that need them and underground to avoid detection by especially the FDA, Ron comes up with an idea to circumvent the fact of selling the drugs - which are not considered drugs yet since they are not FDA approved - directly to the HIV+ population, which then should should not be against the law. Richard Barkley and Dr. Sevard, the FDA's lead man on the file and one of Ron's doctors respectively, the latter who sees clinical trials as the only way to determine the efficacy of drugs despite the fact that Ron and others would have probably died already without these drugs, try to stop Ron and Rayon at every turn. Caught in the middle is Dr. Eve Saks, another of Ron's doctors, who understands why policies are place, but who can sympathize with Ron, Rayon and others - all her patients, directly or indirectly - in their situation. In 1985, in Dallas, the homophobic electrician and rodeo rider Ron Woodroof is a cocaine user that frequently has sex with hookers and promiscuous women. When he faints in his trailer, he is sent to the hospital where Dr. Sevard and Dr. Eve tell him that he is HIV+ and will die within thirty days. Ron also meets trans-gender Rayon, who is drug addicted that also has the disease. Ron does not accept the diagnosis but a couple of days later he realizes that it may be accurate. He researches about the disease and learns that AZT might be lethal for infected people. Further, he discovers that in Mexico there is a doctor with revoked license named Vass that uses alternative drugs in the treatment of AIDS. Ron improves his healthy and decides to sell the drugs in Dallas. He makes a partnership with Rayon and soon he creates the Dallas Buyers Club, where the memberships pay four hundred dollars per month to have the necessary drugs. But the FDA does not accept his research and he is oppressed by the authorities. Ron Woodruff is a man living in Texas in 1985. He drinks, does drugs and sleeps with women, a real alpha male. When he gets injured at work, he is brought to the hospital and as a procedure, they test his blood and when they get the result, they tell him that he has the HIV virus which causes AIDS. They tell him that he has 30 days to get his affairs in order. He doesn't believe them because like most people at the time, he thinks only homosexuals get the disease. When he gets worse, he learns of the drug AZT which can treat the disease. But it's not available to the public so he finds someone who works in a lab and pays him to provide him with it. But when he tells Woodruff he can't get it anymore, Woodruff needs it so he tells Woodrff of a doctor in Mexico who treats people with AIDS. Woodruff goes there and finds the doctor who treats him. After awhile, Woodruff is doing better. The doctor tells him that he doesn't use AZT because it only makes things worse, so he uses his own remedies. Woodruff decides to sell the doctors meds in the US which the medical community refuses to accept. He finds people who want it and business is booming. Eventually the government tries to stop him but he finds a way around them. In mid 1980s Texas, electrician Ron Woodroof is starting to learn that he has AIDS. Though told he had just 30 days left to live, Woodroof refuses to give into despair. He seeks out akternative therapies and smuggles approved drugs into the US from where ever he can find them. Woodroof joins forces with a fellow AIDS patient and begins selling the treatments to the growing number of people who can't wait for the medical establishment to save them. The story of Texas electrician Ron Woodroof and his battle with the medical establishment and pharmaceutical companies after being diagnosed as HIV-positive in 1986, and his search for alternative treatments that helped established a way in which fellow HIV-positive people could join for access to his supplies. In 1985 Dallas, electrician and hustler Ron Woodroof works around the system to help AIDS patients get the medication they need after he is diagnosed with the disease.",1798709|1454468|0454876|1065073|2024544|0947798|1045658|1285016|1800241|2562232|2334873|2278388

If a misstep is to occur, it probably would concern his growing attraction for Sam, who is dating a college student named Craig. All Charlie does know is that his blackouts, letters he writes to his ""friend"", and specific flashbacks - his conscious and subconscious coping mechanisms - have lessened the more he has spent time with these friends. But he may not be able to escape fully his past, specifically issues about who he considered the person he loved most in the world before meeting Sam, namely his now deceased Aunt Helen.

Doris Walker, the no nonsense special events director, persuades the old man to take his place.

While he is successful, Ms. Walker learns that he calls himself Kris Kringle and he claims to be the actual Santa Claus. Despite reassurances by Kringle's doctor that he is harmless, Doris still has misgivings, especially when she has cynically trained herself, and especially her daughter, Susan, to reject all notions of belief and fantasy. And yet, people, especially Susan, begin to notice there is something special about Kris and his determination to advance the true spirit of Christmas amidst the rampant commercialism around him and succeeding in improbable ways. When a raucous conflict with the store's cruelly incompetent psychologist erupts, Kris finds himself held at Bellevue where, in despair, he deliberates fails a mental examination to ensure his commitment. All seems lost until Doris' friend, Fred Gaily, reassure Kris of his worth and agrees to represent him in the fight to secure his release. To achieve that, Fred arranges a formal hearing in which he argues that Kris is sane because he is in fact Santa Claus. What ensues is a bizarre hearing in which people's beliefs are reexamined and put to the test, but even so, it's going to take a miracle for Kris to win. One of Doris Walker's responsibilities at Macy's Department Store in New York City is to organize the famed annual Macy's Christmas Parade.

At this point, Susan, witnessing things she can not explain rationally, begins to wonder if he is who he says he is. To protect herself and the store, Doris, without telling Kris what she is truly doing, makes Kris go through a psychological evaluation through the store's therapist, Granville Sawyer, who wrongly believes he's God's gift to his profession. Because of their antagonism toward each other, Sawyer tries to have Kris committed, which leads to court proceedings as to Kris' sanity. Fred Gailey, Doris' neighbor who is attracted to her, takes Kris' case, in part to be close to Doris, but also to help his friend who he believes is just a kindly and harmless old man. Fred's defense is to prove that Kris is who he says he is: Santa Claus. In the process, Kris wants more than anything to make both Doris and Susan believe in faith, for Doris again and for Susan the first time in her life. Doris Walker a no-nonsense Macy's executive, desperately searches for a new store Santa. She hires Kris Kringle who insists that he's the real Santa Claus.

Rumors that the strange foal is cursed spread and, before long, he is blamed for the drought that sets into the Great Karoo. When even his father, the leader of the herd, blames him for the lack of rain and the subsequent death of his mother, the outcast zebra leaves the confines of his home knowing that he cannot survive in the herd without all his stripes. Khumba ventures beyond the fence - vulnerable to the ferocious Leopard, Phango, who controls the waterholes and terrorizes the animals in the Great Karoo. Khumba is rescued from an opportunistic wild dog by a quirky duo: a wildebeest and an ostrich. Mama V is a self-confessed free spirit who does not want to be the average stay-at-home mom, like other wildebeest. Ironically, she mothers Bradley, a flamboyant but insecure ostrich who overcompensates for his scraggily feathers. When a mystical mantis appears to the foal, drawing a map to what could be interpreted as either water or stripes, the duo join Khumba on his quest in the hope that their own search for a safe waterhole is over. On their journey, Khumba encounters a colorful range of characters including a migrating herd of Springbok in search of greener (and safer) pastures; a new age, bohemian community living safely within the confines of a luxurious national park; an endangered Riverine Rabbit who has survived extinction by mastering a myriad of skills ranging from impersonations to beat-boxing; a group of hysterical Dassies (rock-rabbits) who fanatically worship the Mighty Black Eagle and Nora, a loony, solitary Merino sheep living on an abandoned farm. Through these interactions, Khumba begins to learn that diversity is essential for survival and that one's difference can, in fact, be one's strength. When Khumba, a half-striped zebra is blamed for the lack of rain by the rest of his insular, superstitious herd, he embarks on a daring quest to earn his stripes. In his search for the legendary waterhole in which the first zebras got their stripes, Khumba meets a quirky range of characters, and teams up with an unlikely duo: an overprotective wildebeest, Mama V, and Bradley, a self-obsessed, flamboyant ostrich.

1130884,Shutter Island,"It's 1954, and up-and-coming U.S. marshal Teddy Daniels is assigned to investigate the disappearance of a patient from Boston's Shutter Island Ashecliffe Hospital. He's been pushing for an assignment on the island for personal reasons, but before long he wonders whether he hasn't been brought there as part of a twisted plot by hospital doctors whose radical treatments range from unethical to illegal to downright sinister. Teddy's shrewd investigating skills soon provide a promising lead, but the hospital refuses him access to records he suspects would break the case wide open. As a hurricane cuts off communication with the mainland, more dangerous criminals ""escape"" in the confusion, and the puzzling, improbable clues multiply, Teddy begins to doubt everything - his memory, his partner, even his own sanity. Federal Marshall Teddy Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule travel to a government-run mental institution for the criminally insane on Shutter Island, near Boston, when there is a report that one of the prisoners has gone missing. Daniels has his own reasons for wanting to get to the island and carries baggage of his own. He is still traumatized from what he saw when his army unit liberated one of the Nazi concentration camps at the end of World War II and is still haunted by the more recent death in a fire of his wife. The head of the hospital, Dr. John Cawley, treats him alright but others give the agents a less than warm reception. Daniels particularly wants to find out what is going on in one of the wards, reserved for the most serious offenders. As Daniels begins to peal away the layers of deceit, it becomes obvious that not all is as it seems.

By the start of Kasdan Creswell's first academic term, not all aspects of the merger have been ironed-out. In what was already a threatened music program at both schools, Kasdan's director of music Diana Thiessen and Creswell's director of music Ken Stoddard still have music teaching jobs in the merger running parallel music programs, it not being clear what will happen to either of their jobs based on monetary issues, with the likelihood that both will have jobs by the end of the completed merger low. Diana and Ken already do not see eye to eye on anything music-related, Diana who teaches in an academic fashion primarily of the classics, while Ken wants his students to have free expression of music, his musical teaching bent toward the popular. The easily-stressed school principal, Jessica Gedler, suggests that the two submit their own individual entries to a television sponsored high school Christmas carol contest, the outcome of the contest which would go a long way to convincing the decision makers on who should be the school's music director. The contest is to be a duo singing any Christmas carol in any arrangement. Diana's two female students and Ken's two male students are a disparate bunch: Liz Strait, the girl most like to...; extremely shy Amy Barnes, whose shyness is due to being overprotected by her parents in an effort to shield her from any emotional pain; Billy Warren, the golden boy with an ego large enough to fill a football field; and Carlo, an academically bright student new to the school who is having trouble knowing where to fit in due to being confined to a wheelchair. Because of their differences, it is difficult enough to bring each team together as a cohesive unit, that is until the students learn through the grapevine that their respective teacher's job may be on the line based on the outcome, which leads to the view that the other team is the sworn enemy. Through it all, Diana and Ken are each going through personal issues of their own, specifically in not having an active social life. As hard as they try, they seem not to be able to avoid each other socially, that want to avoid based on most of their conversations ending in a philosophical argument.

0147800,10 Things I Hate About You,"Adapted from William Shakespeare's play ""The Taming of the Shrew,"" 10 Things I Hate About You starts off with Cameron, new student at Padua High, sitting in the office of the quirky guidance counselor Ms. Perky. He is then shown around the school by Michael, who will become his best friend. During his tour is when Cameron first sees Bianca Stratford, a beautiful sophomore with one problem: she isn't allowed to date. And neither is her ""shrew"" sister, Katarina, a senior who loves indie rock and feminist prose and hates conformity. But Kat and Bianca's father alters his house rule: now, Bianca can date... as long as Kat has a date, too. Now, in order for Cameron to date Bianca, he has to find someone to date Kat. So Michael helps him enlist the help of pretty-boy/jerk/model Joey Donner, tricking him into thinking that *he* will get to take Bianca out if he pays someone to take out Kat. His choice: Patrick Verona, a bad-boy with a mysterious reputation--some say he ate a live duck once, others that he lit a state trooper on fire, and even more claim that he had a brief porn career. Will Patrick win Kat's heart? Will Cameron win Bianca's? Or will everything hit the fan...? Bianca Stratford is dying to go out with Joey Donner the babe of their school. Kat Stratford would rather die than go out with a boy. Mr. Stratford has this rule where Bianca can date... when Kat does. Bianca begs her sister to have a night of ""teenage normalcy"" Little does Bianca know that not only Joey is trying to set her sister up but also Cameron her cute, but also unpopular French tutor. Joey and Camereon's ""set up guy"" Patrick is trying to get Kat to go out with him. But does it work, will Kat go out with him? Will Bianca go out with Joey? In an updated version of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew, new kid Cameron James is head over heels for popular sophomore Bianca Stratford, but Bianca's overprotective father forbids her to date Cameron unless Bianca's older ill-tempered, rebellious sister Kat dates. But Joey Donner wants Bianca, so he uses sullen senior Patrick Verona to attempt to win Kat's heart. Will Patrick be able to win Kat over and Cameron will be able to have Bianca? Meet the Stratford sisters: pretty and popular Bianca, who has never had a date; and Kat, her older sibling, an ill-tempered harridan whose acerbic wit is matched only by her steadfast determination to alienate any guy who might be remotely interested in her. Unfortunately, strict rules in the Stratford household forbid Bianca from having a boyfriend until her odious sister has one of her own-a situation that seems highly improbable considering Kat is a social disaster. Bianca's desperation for romance turns into a convoluted scheme to match Kat with her male equivalent--a guy whose reputation is so infamous, Kat might rise to the challenge and find him worthy of her concealed charms. Mating mayhem ensues when Patrick Verona -- a sullen young man with a mysterious past -- is bribed by Bianca's wannabe boyfriend to woo and win Kat, in order to clear the way for Bianca to begin dating. Popular, pretty Bianca Stratford is in dilemma. A family rule forbids her from dating until her unpopular, rebellious, boy-hating older sister Kat gets a suitor of her own. In an attempt to win Bianca, a potential boyfriend desperately attempts to set Kat up with Patrick Verona, another rebel who may just be able to win Kat's heart. A new kid must find a guy to date the meanest girl in school, the older sister of the girl he has a crush on, who cannot date until her older sister does.",0377092|0112697|1282140|0458352|0454945|0250494|1570728|1041829|0251127|1632708|1142988|0337563

However, an unfortunate discovery prompts Marty to go to his friend's aid. Using the time machine, Marty travels to the old west where his friend has run afoul of a gang of thugs and has fallen in love with a local schoolteacher. Using the technology from the time, Marty and Emmett devise one last chance to send the two of them back to the future. This movie picks up where the last one left off--Marty stuck in 1955 after watching the Delorean vanish after being struck by lightning with Doc in it. But moments after, he got a letter from Doc that tells him he was sent to 1885. But the Delorean was damaged and he can't repair it. So he placed it somewhere where he hopes Marty can find it in 1955 and hopefully his younger version can repair it so that Marty can return to 1985. So he goes to the 1955 Doc Brown and tells him about what happened and shows him the letter. So they set out to find the Delorean and do which was hidden near a cemetery. After finding the Delorean, Marty and Doc were about to leave when they find a tombstone with Doc's name on it that says he was killed a few days after he sent the letter and that he was killed by someone named Buford Tannen. Marty and Doc go to the library and learn that Tannen was a crazed gunman and a photo of Doc in 1885. Marty then decides to go back to 1885 to save Doc. Upon arriving, the Delorean gets damaged and the gas tank is leaking. Marty then goes to town to look for Doc. But along the way he meets Tannen and gets on his bad side. Doc saves him and Tannen threatens Doc. Marty then shows Doc the photo of his tombstone. That's when Marty and Doc get ready to leave. But when Marty tells him about the gas tank, Doc tells him, without gas they can't get the Delorean up to 88 miles per hour to activate the time circuits. So they scurry to find a way to get it up to that speed before Doc gets shot. They think they found one which they plan to implement on the day he gets shot. Doc then meets Clara Clayton, the town's new schoolteacher and is smitten with her. That's when he has second thoughts about leaving. When Tannen tries to make a move on Doc, Marty stops him that's when Tannen challenges Marty to a gunfight. Marty initially declines but when Tannen calls him a coward, Marty accepts.

Surviving an Indian attack and unfriendly townsfolk, Marty finds Doc Brown the blacksmith. But with the Doc under the spell of the charming Clara Clayton, it's up to Marty to get them out of the wild west and back to the future.

0052948,Journey to the Center of the Earth,"Prof. Lindenbrook leads his intrepid party on an expedition to the center of the earth, via a volcano in Iceland, encountering all manner of prehistoric monsters and life-threatening hazards on the way. In 1880, newly knighted Sir Oliver Lindenbrook, a renowned scientist teaching at the University of Edinburgh, inadvertently discovers evidence pointing to Arne Saknussemm, an Icelandic scientist from a few centuries earlier, who claimed to have found a pathway from the volcanoes in Iceland to the Earth's center. Sir Oliver writes to Swedish Professor Peter Goetabaug, an expert in world volcanoes, with his findings before proceeding with an expedition to prove Saknussemm's claim, but instead of hearing back from Goetabaug, Lindenbrook learns that Goetabaug has taken the information to glorify his own name via his own expedition. Student Alec McKuen (engaged to Lindenbrook's niece) joins Sir Oliver, quickly embarking for Iceland to beat Goetabaug to the center of the Earth. They find skulduggery in Iceland, with themselves attacked and Goetabaug murdered. Apparently there's a third party involved, whom they'll later learn to be Count Saknussemm, a descendant of Arne and a scientist in his own right. By now, Sir Oliver has recruited Hans Belker, a brawny Icelandic farmer with a beloved pet duck named Gertrude, to join them, but he must also reluctantly include Carla, Professor Goetabaug's widow, who will not provide them with her husband's prized equipment otherwise. As the four with Gertrude proceed on their precarious journey - with Carla and Sir Oliver often at odds with each other - they are initially unaware of the dangerous Count Saknussemm behind them, a crafty, cold-hearted, imperious man who initially needs to rely on Lindenbrook's expertise but who will stop at nothing to beat everyone to the Earth's center, believing this project and all its associated glory rightfully belong to him as a Saknussemm. The question ultimately becomes what to do if they make it to the center. Edinburgh university professor Sir Oliver Lindenbrook believes he has found an very old message from a long lost scientist who may have found the way to journey to the center of the Earth. With his assistant, student Alec McKuen, he sets off for Iceland where an entrance in a volcanic range is to be found. They are soon joined by Carla Goetabaug, whose scientist-husband was recently murdered, and Icelander Hans Belker as they descend into the bowels of the Earth. There they will find fantastic creatures, exotic plants, the lost city of Atlantis and a foe who wants to keep knowledge of this underworld to himself. In 1880, in Edinburgh, Professor Oliver S. Lindenbrook of the local university has been awarded with the title of ""Sir"" and his students have chipped in for a gift including a lava stone. Prof. Lindenbrook researches the lava and finds evidence that the scientist Saknussemm sent it from the center of the Earth one hundred years ago. He sends his findings to his colleague Prof. Peter Goetabaug of Stockholm to endorse his research. But soon he finds that Prof. Goetabaug has betrayed him and traveled to Iceland to organize an expedition to the center of the Earth. Prof. Lindenbrook travels with his prot?g?e Alexander ""Alec"" McKuen to Iceland to organize his own expedition and discovers Prof. Goetabaug murdered by Count Saknussemm who wants to protect the discovery of his ancestor. Prof. Lindenbrook and Alec are forced to team-up with the widow Carla Goetabaug and the strong local Hans Belker who brings his duck Gertrude with him.

Topics centered on nearly every inconceivable matter of concern to children, ranging from everyday fears related to going to sleep, getting immunizations and disappointment about not getting one's way to losing a loved one to death and physical handicaps. Rogers used simple songs and, on nearly every show, segments from the Neighborhood of Make-Believe to make his point. A scale-model trolley was often (but not always) used to segue into the Make-Believe segments, said neighborhood being inhabited by puppet characters including King Friday XIII, Lady Elaine Fairchild and Daniel Striped Tiger. Frequent visitors as well as Rogers' own frequent visits to various places in the neighborhood rounded out each show. The program was taped at WQED-TV in Pittsburgh; first-run shows were produced from 1968 to 1975, at which time production was suspended until 1979. New programs were taped through 2001 for broadcast alongside the original 460 episodes the most notable coming in 1991 with Rogers' shows focusing on calming children's fears during the Persian Gulf War. Fred Rogers explores various topics for young viewers through presentations and music both in his world and in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe.",0085075|0069627|0166048|0063951|0233033|0112225|0190211|0108847|0233041|0136634|0143081|0050022

When both are assigned to kill a man named Benjamin Danz, nicknamed ""The Tank"", they encounter each other on the job and discover the truth. Both employers task one Smith to eliminate the other, and each must choose between their personal and professional lives. A (not entirely happily) married couple, John and Jane Smith (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie) lead seemingly average suburban lives. However, unbeknownst to each other, each of them is a contract killer. Things come to a head when they both get a contract to kill the same guy... A married couple are getting bored with their quiet domestic life. What they don't know, however, is that they're both assassins, secretly hopping the world and killing for hire. But their separate lives are about to collide when they find out their next target is each other. John and Jane Smith are a married couple, both living unexciting lives and attending marriage therapy, as their passion has cooled since they got married. But what they don't know about each other is that they are both professional assassins working for two rival agencies. John's latest assignment is to eliminate Benjaiman ""Tank"" Danz, but it all becomes complicated when Jane is also assigned to eliminate the same target. Learning that they are both assassins and failing to eliminate Danz, John and Jane's separate employers decide that they try to take each other out (John kill Jane, Jane kill John). Engaged in a deadly game, John and Jane try to take each other out and learns more about each other as they try to finish the job and eliminate Danz. John and Jane Smith are a couple who have been married for 6 years and things appear to be normal. But it also appears that things are changing -- they are seeing a marriage counselor. And what neither of them know is that they are professional assassins. However, they are both assigned by their employers to kill the same person. When they each try to take out the target, they get in each other's way and blow the job. Now they are told to go after the person who made them miss the target. And when they learn about each other, they try to take each other out. A bored married couple is surprised to learn that they are both assassins hired by competing agencies to kill each other.",0240772|0332452|0349903|0988045|0496806|1515091|0448157|0416449|0421715|0480249|0343818|1243957

0418279,Transformers,"A long time ago, far away on the planet of Cybertron, a war is being waged between the noble Autobots (led by the wise Optimus Prime) and the devious Decepticons (commanded by the dreaded Megatron) for control over the Allspark, a mystical talisman that would grant unlimited power to whoever possesses it. The Autobots managed to smuggle the Allspark off the planet, but Megatron blasts off in search of it. He eventually tracks it to the planet of Earth (circa 1850), but his reckless desire for power sends him right into the Arctic Ocean, and the sheer cold forces him into a paralyzed state. His body is later found by Captain Archibald Witwicky, but before going into a comatose state Megatron uses the last of his energy to engrave into the Captain's glasses a map showing the location of the Allspark, and to send a transmission to Cybertron. Megatron is then carried away aboard the Captain's ship. A century later, Captain Witwicky's grandson Sam Witwicky (nicknamed Spike by his friends) buys his first car. To his shock, he discovers it to be Bumblebee, an Autobot in disguise who is to protect Spike, who possesses the Captain's glasses and the map engraved on them. But Bumblebee is not the only Transformer to have arrived on Earth - in the desert of Qatar, the Decepticons Blackout and Scorponok attack a U.S. military base, causing the Pentagon to send their special Sector Seven agents to capture all ""specimens of this alien race."" Spike and his girlfriend Mikaela find themselves in the midst of a grand battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons, stretching from Hoover Dam all the way to Los Angeles. Meanwhile, deep inside Hoover Dam, the cryogenically stored body of Megatron awakens. High-school student Sam Witwicky buys his first car, who is actually the Autobot Bumblebee. Bumblebee defends Sam and his girlfriend Mikaela Banes from the Decepticon Barricade, before the other Autobots arrive on Earth. They are searching for the Allspark, and the war on Earth heats up as the Decepticons attack a United States military base in Qatar. Sam and Mikaela are taken by the top-secret agency Sector 7 to help stop the Decepticons, but when they learn the agency also intends to destroy the Autobots, they formulate their own plan to save the world. When the father of the teenager Sam Witwicky gives an old Camaro to him, he has a chance to give a ride to his schoolmate Mikaela Banes and participate of an ancient war of robots on planet Earth. His car is actually the Autobot Bumblebee, leaded by Optimus Prime, and they are in war against the evil Deceptions, leaded by Megatron. Both races are seeking the cube Allspark with opposite intentions: the Autobots intend to protect the human beings, while the Deceptions want to destroy them. When teenager Sam Witwicky buys his first car, what he doesn't know, is that it's actually an alien robot. This isn't the only alien to arrive on Earth. Optimus Prime and a fellow group of transforming robots have arrived in search of the Allspark. But Optimus Prime and the Autobots aren't the only aliens to appear. Megatron and the Decepticons are also searching for the Allspark, and they would do anything to get it, even if it means destroying the world. Sam Witwicky, after persuading his teacher to give him an A, gets his first car, an old Camaro. One day, Sam's car drives itself to an old junkyard where it trnsforms into Autobot Bumblebee, with the objective of protcting Sam. Meanwhile, a decepticon attacks a US military base in Qatar. It tries to steal some data but is interrupted by the base commander who cuts all server hardlines. Only a handful of soldiers survive and are taken for debriefing. The Autobots land on Earth and explain to Sam about the Allspark, an object with power to creat worlds and fill them with life. Sam finds his great great grand father's glasses on which is imprinted the cube's location. As both Autobots and Decepticon fight for the Allspark, who will it be to take the source to limitless power?

In Beverly Hills, Edward, in needing that woman on his arms as he and Philip work toward taking over the company owned by the increasingly insolvent James Morse, decides, based on a chance encounter, to hire Hollywood Boulevard hooker Vivian Ward as his escort for the week 24/7. He does so because he wants to have a professional who would be committed to the work, yet not have any commitments to her after the week is over. Beyond their chance encounter, he also makes this decision because she surprises him about unhookerish she is in certain respects. Vivian, relatively new to Los Angeles and the business, still has to look and act the part, with Edward, beyond giving her money, leaving her largely to her own devices to do so. So she gets a somewhat unlikely Henry Higgins in Barney Thompson, the manager of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel where Edward is staying. Barney has to draw that fine line of keeping the hotel's upscale clients happy, while maintaining the posh decorum of the upper class, which does not include people coming into the hotel looking for rooms with hourly rates. As Barney and his associates are able to transform Vivian into a Cinderella, the questions become whether Vivian can go back to her Hollywood Boulevard life and whether she does have her Prince Charming beyond this week in the form of Edward or anyone else who truly does see her as Cinderella as opposed to a Hollywood Boulevard streetwalker. Edward is a rich, ruthless businessman who specializes in taking over companies and then selling them off piece by piece. He travels to Los Angeles for a business trip and decides to hire a prostitute. They take a liking to each other and he offers her money if she'll stay with him for an entire week while he makes the ""rich and famous"" scene (since it doesn't do for a man of his stature to be alone at society parties and polo matches). Romantic comedy (and complications) ensue. Vivian Ward has found a way of living by working as a prostitute on Hollywood Boulevard. When she runs into the prince of her dreams, who comes along on his wild horse, she first does not recognize him as her saviour. The prince, a ruthless and wealthy businessman by the name of Edward Lewis, does not know that she could be more than just a girl from the sidewalk, but he changes his decision after the first night with the beautiful stranger. Her being the first person in a long time who could surprise him, Edward can slowly feel the light at the end of the tunnel. He is on his way to become a better person, whereas Vivian has got a new chance to start over again. A man in a legal but hurtful business needs an escort for some social events, and hires a beautiful prostitute he meets... only to fall in love.",0125439|0243155|0119738|0457939|0458352|0092890|0163187|0314331|0317198|0251127|0195685|0099653

2278388,The Grand Budapest Hotel,"GRAND BUDAPEST HOTEL recounts the adventures of Gustave H, a legendary concierge at a famous European hotel between the wars, and Zero Moustafa, the lobby boy who becomes his most trusted friend. The story involves the theft and recovery of a priceless Renaissance painting and the battle for an enormous family fortune -- all against the back-drop of a suddenly and dramatically changing Continent. A teenage girl visits the monument of the writer who penned the book, ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"". In 1968, that author was inspired to write the book when he visited that hotel, located in the European mountainous country formerly known as Zubrowka. Once a luxurious hotel, it, in 1968, has fallen on hard times. The author meets the then current owner, M. Zero Moustafa, who recounts the story of how he became the hotel's owner and why he holds onto it and keeps it open despite it obviously making him no money. Zero's story begins in 1932, when the hotel was in its golden era. Zero was the novice immigrant lobby boy, who, like all the other hotel staff, was under the guidance of M. Gustave H., the devoted concierge. Gustave aimed to please, he giving the guests whatever they wanted, especially the wealthy blonde women. The story largely revolves around one of those women, the wealthy Madame C?line Villeneuve Desgoffe-und-Taxis - better known as Mme. D. - her opportunistic son Dimitri, the bequeathing of a valuable painting called ""Boy with Apple"" to Gustave, the mysterious circumstances surrounding her death which is initially pinned on Gustave, and the attempts of Zero, his girlfriend - a baker's assistant named Agatha - and others to clear Gustave's name while Dimitri does whatever he needs to get what he believes is rightfully his, namely the painting. A writer travels to the decadent Grand Budapest Hotel in the mountains of the Republic of Zubrowka and he meets the owner Mr. Zero Moustafa, who is a very simple man. Zero invites the author to have dinner with him and he tells his story and how he became the owner of the hotel. In 1932, in the glorious days of the Grand Budapest Hotel, Zero Moustafa is hired to work as lobby boy under the command of the legendary concierge Monsieur Gustave H that becomes his friend. Gustave efficiently manages the hotel and staff and also attends the sexual needs of the old ladies lodged at the hotel. He spends one night with Madame C?line Villeneuve ""Madame D"" Desgoffe und Taxis and soon he learns that she was found dead at home. Gustave summons Zero to travel with him to the funeral and he learns that he has inherited the valuable painting Boy with Apple. Madame D's son Dimitri and her family do not accept that a concierge may have inherited the painting and Gustave and Zero steal it and return to the Grand Budapest Hotel. Gustave promises Zero that he would be his heir for helping him. But Gustave is falsely accused of murdering Madame D and is arrested and imprisoned. Will his friend Zero leave him die in the prison? In the far reaches Eastern Europe in the former Republic of Zubrowka, there once was the Grand Budapest hotel. A writer remembers a stay at the hotel during the off season many years ago and recalls the tales he heard of the hotel's past from the elderly owner, Mr. Mustafa. He tells the young writer about how he came to acquire the hotel and of the original concierge of the Grand Budapest, M. Gustave H. Mustafa was a lobby boy at the time and accompanies Gustave to the reading of a will after one of their regular guests dies. She leaves Gustave a valuable painting but when the woman's son challenges the will, Gustave and Mustafa steal the painting setting off a series of events that will lead to Mustafa present circumstance.

Powers that was arrested alive after his plane was shot down by the Soviet Union during a mission- with a KGB intelligence officer, Rudolf Abel who was arrested for espionage in the US. In 1957, lawyer James B. Donovan is recruited from his prestigious law firm to defend accused Soviet spy Rudolf Abel. It's an unenviable task in many respects. Donovan hasn't practiced criminal law since he was a prosecutor at the Nuremburg trials after World War II. Also, the strong anti-Communist mood at the time makes him a target from who think Abel should just be executed. Abel is convicted but Donovan convinces the judge to sentence him to prison, rather than execute him, as they may at some point in the future want to swap him for an American spy the Soviets might have in custody. Just such a scenario comes into play when in 1960 U-2 spy pilot Francis Gary Powers is shot down over Soviet territory and taken prisoner. Donovan is again recruited to act as the intermediary and negotiate swapping Able for the American requiring him to travel to East Berlin crossing the newly built Berlin Wall. After Abel, the Russian spy is caught, the US wants to make sure he gets a fair trial so they need someone to defend him. And the man who gets the dubious honor is Jim Donovan who tries to give him a good defense but the government seems intent on making sure he gets convicted. And when Abel is found guilty, Donovan pleads for Abel not to be executed because who knows they might need him as a bargaining chip if an American is captured by the Russians. And when U2 pilot Gary Powers is captured, someone from East Germany sends Donovan a letter claiming to be able to broker an exchange; Powers for Abel. When the CIA learns of this, they want Donovan to go there and broker the deal. He agrees. But when he arrives he is informed that another American is being held by the Germans and he could be the one that's being offered for Abel. But the CIA tells Donovan Powers is the priority. Donovan tries to get both men. During the Cold War, an American lawyer is recruited to defend an arrested Soviet spy in court, and then help the CIA facilitate an exchange of the spy for the Soviet captured American U2 spy plane pilot, Francis Gary Powers.",1895587|3659388|1596363|2080374|2379713|3397884|1392190|3170832|2381111|1355683|3203606|3076658

He survives and credits the photo for saving him. He tries to find the owner but can't, assuming he was killed. When he goes back to the States, he finds it difficult to adjust and is still haunted by what happened. Analyzing the photo, he finds in the background a landmark that tells him she is in Louisiana. He then goes there and finds her. He learns her name is Beth. He tries to tell her what happened but can't get the words out. She assumes he's there to apply for the job they advertised looking for someone to help at her family's business, a dog kennel. He says yes but at first she gets an uneasy feeling from him but her grandmother decides to give him a chance. It isn't long that he makes a connection with her son. He then discovers that it was her brother who had the picture only he doesn't remember him. He sees that her brother's death has a profound effect on her. Eventually they get close which makes her grandmother happy but not her ex who is a deputy sheriff who's always threatening to take their son away from her. In Iraq, marine Sergeant Logan finds the photo of a young woman with the message ""Keep Safe X"" on the back in the debris of a construction and he keeps it in his pocket. His action saves his life from a mortar fire and he believes that the girl is his guardian angel that protects him. When he returns to Colorado, he has difficulties to adjust to civilian life with his sister's family and he decides to seek out the woman. Logan researches the landscape and finds that the place is Hamden, in Louisiana, and he walks with his dog Zeus to Hamden. He discovers that the woman is Beth Green, who is the owner of Green Kennels with her grandmother Ellie. When Logan meets Beth, he is unable to tell the reason why he had traveled to Hamden, she assumes that he wants the job that she had advertised, and Ellie gives the job to Logan. Soon Logan befriends Beth's son Ben and becomes close to the family. But her former husband, Sheriff Keith Clayton does not want to make Logan's life easy. US Marine Logan Thibault is on his third tour of duty in Iraq. The morning after a deadly battle, he spots among some rubble a photograph of a young Caucasian woman, with only the words ""Keep Safe X"" scrawled on the back. In retrieving the photo, he misses being killed by a bomb that hit where he was just sitting. Carrying the photo looking for its owner, he, unable to find that person, encounters one near miss after another, leading to his surviving comrades and himself believing the photograph and by association the woman his guardian angel. Back in the States, he, suffering from PTSD exacerbated by guilt over surviving when many of his colleagues died in battle, goes searching for the woman, who he believes may bring some semblance of meaning back into his life. With only a partial landmark in the photo background, he is able to trace her to the small hamlet of Hamden, Louisiana. She is Beth Green, and the photo belonged to her brother, Logan's fellow Marine Drake Green, whose death in Iraq is still under investigation but which the military believes may have been by friendly fire. In her grief, Beth, a single mom to eight year old Ben, has temporarily left her teaching job while she and Ben live with her ""Nana"" and helps at the family's kennel business. Logan is unable to tell Beth the reason for his visit as Nana hires him to work at the kennel. Able to get over her initial mistrust of Logan, Beth eventually falls for him, who becomes an integral part not only of the business but in the Green's family life, especially as a male role model for Ben. Logan and Beth having a happily ever after is threatened by the truth of why Logan came to Hamden, and by Beth's ex-husband, Deputy Sheriff Keith Clayton, who still treats Beth like his possession, and who uses his position as law enforcement and the family name - his father being a judge who is running for Hamden mayor - to get what he wants, which includes threats of suing for full custody of Ben.

Discovering her name is Beth and where she lives, he shows up at her door, and ends up taking a job at her family-run local kennel.

1041829,The Proposal,"For three years, Andrew Paxton has slaved as the assistant to Margaret Tate, hard-driving editor at a New York publisher. When Margaret, a Canadian, faces deportation for an expired visa, she hatches a scheme to marry Andrew - he agrees if she'll promise a promotion. A skeptical INS agent vows to test the couple about each other the next Monday. Andrew had plans to fly home that weekend for his grandma's 90th, so Margaret goes with him - to Sitka, Alaska - where mom, dad, and grams await. Family dynamics take over: tensions between dad and Andrew, an ex-girlfriend, Andrew's dislike of Margaret, and her past color the next few days, with the INS ready to charge Andrew with fraud. In New York, Margaret Tate is a successful self-made chief-editor of the Ruick & Hunt Publishing and loathed by her coworkers. Margaret lost her parents when she was sixteen and is tough with the employees of the office. Her executive assistant and aspirant editor Andrew Paxton has been working with her for three years without any recognition. When Margaret has problems with the immigration due to an expired visa and is threatened with deportation, she blackmails Andrew to agree to marry her. In return, he would be promoted to editor and she would publish his book. Meanwhile, the skeptical clerk of the immigration department Mr. Gilbertson schedules an interview with Margaret and Andrew after the weekend. The couple travels to Sitka, Alaska, to celebrate the ninetieth birthday of Andrew's grandmother and Margaret is welcomed by his warming family. Over the weekend, she grows closer to Andrew's family who ask her to marry Andrew in their barn, a family tradition in the Paxton family. And the tension increases when Mr. Gilbertson appears out of the blue in Sitka promising to charge Andrew for fraud. Margaret Tate is the professionally well-respected but personally loathed senior editor at a prestigious New York publishing house. That personal loathing extends to her staff, who call her a witch behind her back, and to her life away from the office, she who is all alone in the world. Andrew Paxton, her efficient executive assistant, has put up with working for her for three years despite too loathing her solely in his career path to become an editor in his own right. A Canadian, Margaret learns that she is being deported back to Canada on expiration of her work visa. To avoid that deportation, she, with Andrew in attendance, tells, on a spur of the moment thought to company Board Chair Bergen, that she and Andrew are engaged and about to get married. In private with Margaret, Andrew agrees to her proposal on the guarantee that he immediately gets promoted to editor and that his own manuscript, which he long ago gave to Margaret to read, be published. Andrew holds to the agreement even after Margaret's case comes to the attention of Mr. Gilbertson at the Immigration Bureau, who threatens Andrew with prosecution for fraud if their imminent marriage is solely one of convenience. In preparation for their next immigration meeting, Andrew and Margaret will have the weekend truly to get to know each other as they head to Andrew's ""Gammy Annie""'s ninetieth birthday party in Andrew's hometown of... Sitka, Alaska. There, Andrew may have an upper hand in his new relationship with Margaret as they feel she has more at stake in their arrangement, and as Margaret is a fish out of water in Alaska. But other issues that come into play are: Andrew's loving family, especially Gammy Annie and Andrew's mother, Grace, welcoming Margaret despite Andrew's previous rants about what a horrible person she is; Andrew's strained relationship with his wealthy father, Joe, over Joe not understanding why Andrew doesn't want to take over the family businesses in Sitka; and Andrew being reunited with his high school and college girlfriend, Gertrude, who he once asked to marry him. Over the course of the weekend under these circumstances, both Margaret and Andrew may come to a realization of what they really want in life. A pushy boss (Sandra Bullock) forces her young assistant (Ryan Reynolds) to marry her in order to keep her Visa status in the U.S. and avoid deportation to Canada.",0251127|0458352|1142988|1632708|0988595|1282140|1411238|1570728|0377092|0337563|0212346|1055292

He is not told of their fate, but shuttled from one selfish relative to the next, ending with ""Gramp,"" a kindly ex-vaudevillean. Peter and Gramp, both fond of ""Irish bulls,"" get along fine; but the morning after Peter finally learns he's an orphan, his hair spontaneously turns green! The absurd over-reactions of stupid people overturn his life as the story becomes a parable. The police find a pre-teen boy with a shaved head they do not know, and who will not divulge who he is to them. It isn't until the police bring in sympathetic child psychologist Dr. Evans that the boy decides to tell his story, including the reason for his shaved head. His name is Peter Fry, who currently lives with a relative he calls Gramp, despite Gramp not being Peter's true grandfather. Prior to Gramp, Peter was shuttled between several other relatives while Peter's parents were away. Since his life with his parents, it wasn't until he started living with Gramp, a retired performer who now works as a singing waiter, that Peter felt like a normal boy in a loving and stable home. This supportive life also includes several friends at school, under the sympathetic wing of their teacher, Miss Brand. It wasn't until Miss Brand organized a clothing drive for war orphans that Peter found out that that his own parents were killed in the war, meaning that he too is a war orphan, hence the true reason for living with relatives. This newfound status made Peter start to think about the war, the plight of war orphans, and the sanctity of life. Peter woke up one morning to find that his normally brown hair had turned to green. Although Peter and all those around him had various reactions to his green hair, he eventually came to a belief of what the green hair meant, and the important mission associated with it. But the action of others, who were less certain as to why Peter's hair turned green, led to where Peter is today. With Dr. Evans and Gramp's help among others, Peter may come back to truly appreciating who he is and his special place in the world. In a police station, a child psychologist uses his ability to interview a runaway boy with hairs completely cut-off that is reluctant to speak. The boy tells that his name is Peter Fry and his parents had traveled to London and have not returned yet; meanwhile he is living with Gramp Fry, after being lodged in the houses of many relatives for short periods. He gets along with Gramp, the locals, his schoolmates and his teacher; however, when he discovers that he is an orphan of war, his hair turns green on the next morning and Peter is rejected by his community. This parable looks at public reaction when the hair of an American war orphan mysteriously turns green.",0049030|0064806|0041855|0057523|0046004|0059243|0052427|0049096|0044685|0037059|0058230|0042644

The rich ""earn"" decades at a time (remaining at age 25), becoming essentially immortal, while the rest beg, borrow or steal enough hours to make it through the day. When a man from the wrong side of the tracks is falsely accused of murder, he is forced to go on the run with a beautiful hostage. Living minute to minute, the duo's love becomes a powerful tool in their war against the system. In a future society, people are genetically modified to stop aging at twenty five and after that a clock is activated with one more year for each citizen. Time is a currency and the wealthy that live in the New Greenwich are immortals while the poor live in ghettos in time zones are exploited and forced to live with a few hours or days, and need to work, borrow, beg or steal to stay alive. Thieves steal time and the timekeepers control the society. When the worker Will Salas saves the rich Henry Hamilton from a dangerous gang of thieves, Henry tells that he is 105 years old and is tired of living, since there is no need for the deaths in the unfair society. When Will sleeps, Henry gives more than one hundred years to him and commits suicide. Will runs to meet his mother Rachel Salas to credit time to her but she dies before the transference. Will heads to New Greenwich but the timekeeper Raymond Leon believes that he killed Henry to steal his time. Will flirts with Sylvia Weis, who is the spoiled daughter of the millionaire Philippe Weis, in a party and when Raymond arrests him, Will Salas kidnaps Sylvia and brings her to the ghetto where he lives. Sylvia feels how despicable her father is and together with Will, they steal a large quantity of time to fight against the system. In a future society people have been engineered not to age once reaching 25 but can only live for one more year as time is now the currency. Those who trade it can live for more than a 100 years. Society's classes are divided into what they call time zones. The richest live in the Greenwich section. One of the residents of Greenwich wanders into the poor section where someone sees how much time he has which is 100 years and wants to steal it. Will Salas, a decent guy saves him but he tells Will that he wanted to die because he's tired of a system wherein someone has to die for others to live. While Will is sleeping he gives Will his time and walks off to die. Will goes off to share it with his mother but she dies because of inflation. Will heads off to Greenwich. He then meets a girl named Sylvia whose father is the one behind the system. A law enforcement office known as a Timekeeper who's investigating the death of the man who gave Will his time, assumes that Will stole it. So he confiscates it and arrests Will. Will then takes Sylvia hostage and runs off with her. He goes back to his time zone and asks for a ransom but when her father doesn't give it. He lets her go but when she's in danger Will saves her and they decide to work together to take down the system. In the future when the aging gene has been switched off, people must pay to stay alive. To avoid overpopulation, time has become the currency that people use to pay for luxuries and necessities from a clock implanted in their forearm. This can easily be transferred among individuals on body contact. The rich can live forever, while the rest try to negotiate for their immortality. A poor young man is accused of murder when he inherits a fortune of time from a dead upper class man, though too late to help his mother from dying. He is forced to go on the run from a corrupt police force known as 'time keepers In a future where people stop aging at 25, but are engineered to live only one more year, having the means to buy your way out of the situation is a shot at immortal youth. Here, Will Salas finds himself accused of murder and on the run with a hostage - a connection that becomes an important part of the way against the system.",1219289|0945513|0289879|0480249|1276104|0443543|1670345|0988045|0448157|1515091|1535108|0343818

Peppy, who appreciates everything that Valentin did for her career, tries to help him as much as she can, but Valentin may have to decide on his own where and if he fits into the Hollywood machine, one where he doesn't think people want to hear him speak.

The sin of Gluttony comes first and the murderer's terrible capacity is graphically demonstrated in the dark and subdued tones characteristic of film noir.

Taking place in a nameless city, Se7en follows the story of two homicide detectives tracking down a sadistic serial killer who chooses his victims according to the seven deadly sins.

Harry, who works for a greeting card company, has just been promoted to a marketing position in the NYC corporate office from his long time job as a traveling salesman, and will soon look for permanent accommodations in the city. In middle age, Harry sought out this more stable job to lead a more stable life. So instead of a different girl in every city, he will soon be married to Phyllis, also of Altoona. Harry will have an instant family in Phyllis' early teen son Patrick, who Harry has not yet met as Patrick is attending boarding school in New England.

Within this setting, Evie likes to portray herself as being important, leaving herself messages at the front desk and having herself paged. Most of the conventioneers, with the exception of the more elderly judgmental women, use the opportunity to have the stereotypical convention experience, meaning leaving thoughts of spouses and children at home to cut loose with the other conventioneers. She had in past years whooped it up with the married male conventioneers, but now, in middle age, is more interested in settling down in a real relationship. A situation related indirectly to Phyllis follows Harry to the hotel which makes Harry question his decision to settle down with an instant family. As such, Harry decides to return, at least temporarily, to his old lifestyle with loose women who just want to have fun. In this mindset, Harry, after some other female companionship, does eventually encounter Evie at the hotel, she who is interested in him until she learns that he is ""married"". When Phyllis arrives in NYC to join Harry in their new life, Harry, based partly on the time he spends with Evie over the course of their stay at the hotel, may get a better picture of what both he and Phyllis want in their futures.",0056956|0036022|0055124|0069303|0063821|0036940|0046004|0041890|0053271|0032264

0061301,Spider-Man,"Student Peter Parker is bitten by a spider while witnessing an experiment in radiology and finds that the radiation has transferred the properties of the spider (ability to scale walls and swing on webs) to him with a strength proportional to his body. Peter now has super spider powers and is so preoccupied with their possibilities that he fails to help the police stop a thief, who later robs the house of Peter's guardians, Aunt May and Uncle Ben, and kills Ben. Furious, Peter tracks down the culprit at a warehouse, and, on seeing the man's face, Peter realizes that if he had acted earlier to help stop the crook, Ben would be alive now. So, Peter vows to use his new powers to fight crime, as the super-heroic Spider-Man. The 1967 'Spider-Man' series displayed the web-slinging crime-fighter for the first time outside the comic book. Peter Parker, an ordinary college student, is bitten by a radioactive spider and soon finds he has the spider's ability to climb across buildings and swing across streets. After his Uncle Ben is murdered by a thief he surprised, Peter assumes the identity of Spider-Man to go after the low-lifes who plague Manhattan's streets. For 3 years, he battled with such villains as Dr. Octopus, the Green Goblin, the Kingpin, Mysterio, the Radiation Specialist, Clive, and the Rhino - always putting an end to their criminal ambitions. The 1967 incarnation of ""Spider-Man"" marked the web-slinging hero's first television series. Spider-Man was based on the popular Marvel Comics comic-book hero. Peter Parker is a college student who works as a freelance photographer for the Daily Bugle. He acquires his superpowers after being bitten by a spider that had been exposed to nuclear radiation. Peter, who struggled to understand his newfound superpowers (which included the ability to sling giant webs on various villians and scale sheer walls), used his Spider-Man alias to fight the forces of evil. Other characters were Betty Brant, a stenographer at the Bugle, and J. Jonah Jameson, the newspaper's editor. Later programs starring or featuring Spider-Man included ""The Electric Company"" (about two dozen three-minute segments were produced, featuring that show's cast as the villians and supporting characters); a new animated series, ""Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends"" (and later, shared billing with the Incredible Hulk) that aired on NBC in the 1980s; and another new animated version of Spider-Man on Fox's children's schedule, starting in 1995.

This behavior has caused Amelia Windsor to be a disgrace to her royal family. She is then given the choice of going to a strict camp in England and returning to the same school in the fall or sent to another school in America where she can learn how to behave. This school is a very rough, downtown, locals only school. She chooses the latter and is packed off immediately. On the plane she opens a letter from her father explaining that there is one important rule she must adhere to and this is to not tell anyone who she is ie royalty. We see Craig with his friends in a bar, Craig is a very big tall black guy who is obviously quite hardcore and you wouldn't want to mess with him, his first scene is where he gets into a fight in this bar and is arrested. As we see him in his cell, the police officer obviously knows him and asks ""what did he do this time and that he really needs to move on and find another job"", he explains the CIA were his life and he doesn't know what else he can do. He is sent home and we see a text and link arrive on his phone as he is heading into his flat, he opens it and sees its from his friend and it's a job description. Its asking for a bodyguard. It explains its top secret and its urgent. Craig arrives at the airport in blacktops style gear, all he knows is that he is to meet ""the package"" from the plane and deliver it to an address. We see the plane arrive and comments saying there is a problem and anyone in arrivals will be informed as soon as possible to when the passengers will be ready to leave the aircraft. The next thing we see is Ameila being escorted by police into customs. Craigs phone rings and we see he is being told to meet the package somewhere else. He is taken into a room and questioned. He says he knows nothing but this email that was sent to him. We see it's the match to the one the airport police have so they are very relieved to hand Amelia over once the huge fine is paid. Craig says there must be some kind of mistake but no, Amelia is the package. He thinks she will be easy to handle but through scenes of escape and parties and missing school. As well as hilarious scenes where they have to disguise Amelia through clothes and her accent and wigs. She proves she is quite a handful. Their relationship develops over the course of the film where Craig learns there is more to life than just work and actually starts to care for a girl he meets and Amelia, as well as Amelia realizing she needs to stop being so selfish and start thinking about her actions and their consequences. The finale is when Craig rescues her from a life and death situation.",

4065316,Best Christmas Party Ever,"Jennie Stanton (Torrey DeVitto) throws the best Christmas parties every year for her company, Petra's Parties. Things are a little different this year, as Petra is retiring and looks to the next generation to take over. Jennie thinks she has her new job in the bag, until Petra's charismatic nephew, Nick (Steve Lund), shows up as ""seasonal help"" and his natural talent and confidence clashes with Jennie's stern work ethic and traditional values. The pair battle it out for the top job with unmistakable chemistry and symmetry, but when the new owners of the legendary Tyrell's Toys put the bottom line before Christmas spirit, threatening to pull the plug on Tyrell's Toys' annual Christmas party for the community, Jennie and Nick are forced to work together to throw the greatest Christmas party ever. Twenty-something Jennie Stanton is the second in command at Petra's Parties, New York City's preeminent events planning company. The company has long held the contract to organize Tyrell's Toy Store's Christmas party, which is open to the public and which at its core provides Christmas cheer to those less fortunate. Arthur Tyrell, the store's original owner, gave Jennie's father a job when Jennie was a child, at a time when the Stantons' outlook was at its most bleak. It is her remembrances of the parties as a child and her fondness for Arthur Tyrell that made Jennie want to become an events planner, and why Tyrell's is the job she looks the most forward to year after year. Arthur Tyrell has sold the store to a conglomerate called Piedmont, which will continue with the parties. Piedmont's liaison on this file, Todd Perry, seems more interested in Jennie as a woman than as an events planner, largely leaving the details of the party to her. Petra's Parties has another major shake-up when Petra announces at the beginning of this Christmas season that she will be going into retirement after Christmas. She has brought in her fraternal nephew, Nick Forbes, to help at the company this season, Petra wanting Jennie to show him the ropes. This request does not sit well with Jennie as Nick's easy going and off the cuff style, largely an extension of him being an actor, does not mesh with her more detail-oriented focus. Jennie's worst nightmare comes to pass when she eventually learns that Petra plans to hand over the reigns of the company to Nick, rather than to her, which was her expectation before Nick came into the picture. Nick, on the other hand, wants to learn, and has nothing against Jennie whatsoever, he who sees this opportunity as a means to lead a more stable life than the struggle of going on audition after audition. He even has Jennie's back, believing Todd to be nothing more than a player. Although continually butting heads at the beginning, Jennie slowly warms to the strengths that Nick has in dealing with customers, that innate free-spirited charm which she admits she doesn't have. But the true test of if they can indeed be a team ends up being Piedmont, Todd who does have specific ideas of what he envisions the party to be, which is not what has traditionally been done. Jennie and Nick have to find a way to retain the true meaning of Christmas at Tyrell's while either getting Todd and Piemont on board or circumventing Piedmont's wants.",4177742|2994382|3214240|3131532|0385567|2374486|1264895|2376272|4160132|4159212|3320502|5070196

0082971,Raiders of the Lost Ark,"The year is 1936. An archeology professor named Indiana Jones is venturing in the jungles of South America searching for a golden statue. Unfortunately, he sets off a deadly trap but miraculously escapes. Then, Jones hears from a museum curator named Marcus Brody about a biblical artifact called The Ark of the Covenant, which can hold the key to humanly existence. Jones has to venture to vast places such as Nepal and Egypt to find this artifact. However, he will have to fight his enemy Rene Belloq and a band of Nazis in order to reach it. Renowned archeologist and expert in the occult, Dr. Indiana Jones, is hired by the U.S. Government to find the Ark of the Covenant, which is believed to still hold the ten commandments. Unfortunately, agents of Hitler are also after the Ark. Indy, and his ex-flame Marion, escape from various close scrapes in a quest that takes them from Nepal to Cairo. The year is 1936. Archeology professor Indiana Jones narrowly escapes death in a South American temple with a gold idol - by poison dart, fall, and finally a giant boulder that chases him out the front. An old enemy, Rene Belloq, steals the idol and then orders Hovito indians after Indy. Indy, however, escapes back to the USA, where Army Intelligence officers are waiting for him at his university. They tell him about a flurry of Nazi archaeological activity near Cairo, which Indy determines to be the possible resting place of the Ark of the Covenant - the chest that carried the 10 Commandments. The Ark is believed to carry an incredibly powerful energy that must not fall into Nazi hands. Indiana is immediately sent overseas, stopping in Nepal to pick up an old girlfriend (his old professor's daughter) and then meeting up in Cairo with his friend Sallah. But danger lurks everywhere in the form of Nazi thugs, and poisonous snakes in the Ark's resting place. After Belloq, hired by the Nazis, makes off again with the Ark, Indy & Marion are determined to get it back, and they overpower the pilot of a German plane. But Indy finds himself confronted with a giant German thug, and after a frightening hand-to-hand fight Indy & Marion blow up the plane. Now the Nazis must drive the Ark to Cairo, but Indy regains control of the Ark after running the convoy off the road, one vehicle at a time. Once again the Nazis recapture the Ark...and Marion, heading for a Nazi-controlled island. There, Belloq will open the Ark...to demonstrate the horrific power it can unleash upon the world! Spring 1936. In the thick jungle of the South American continent, a renowned archeologist and expert on the occult is studying fragments of a map, when one of his exploration party pulls a gun. The archeologist pulls out a bullwhip and with such disarms the turncoat, sending him running - thus does Dr. Henry ""Indiana"" Jones stay alive. He and a guide enter a dank and oppressively vast cave that contains several traps created by the ancient race which hid inside a famous handheld statue; Indy barely escapes such traps but is cornered by native tribesmen served by Belloq, an old enemy who arrogantly makes off with the statue, while Indy must flee for his life and escape on a friend's seaplane. Back in the US two agents from US Army intelligence tell him of Nazi German activities in archeology, including a gigantic excavation site in Egypt - a site that an intercepted cable indicates to Indy is the location of the Ark of the Covenant, the powerful chest bearing the Ten Commandments, that the Nazis can use to obliterate any enemy. Indy must recruit a former girlfriend (the daughter of his old professor) and an old chum in Cairo to infiltrate the Nazi site and make off with the Ark, but along the way Indy gets involved in a series of fights, chases, and traps, before the Nazis learn the full power of the Ark. Archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones is hired by the US government to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis.",0097576|0087469|0088763|0103064|0080684|0107290|0076759|0086190|0367882|0167261|0088247|0120737

1596363,The Big Short,"Three separate but parallel stories of the U.S mortgage housing crisis of 2005 are told. Michael Burry, an eccentric ex-physician turned one-eyed Scion Capital hedge fund manager, has traded traditional office attire for shorts, bare feet and a Supercuts haircut. He believes that the US housing market is built on a bubble that will burst within the next few years. Autonomy within the company allows Burry to do largely as he pleases, so Burry proceeds to bet against the housing market with the banks, who are more than happy to accept his proposal for something that has never happened in American history. The banks believe that Burry is a crackpot and therefore are confident in that they will win the deal. Jared Vennett with Deutschebank gets wind of what Burry is doing and, as an investor believes he too can cash in on Burry's beliefs. An errant telephone call to FrontPoint Partners gets this information into the hands of Mark Baum, an idealist who is fed up with the corruption in the financial industry. Baum and his associates, who work at an arms length under Morgan Stanley, decide to join forces with Vennett despite not totally trusting him. In addition to Burry's information, they further believe that most of the mortgages are overrated by the bond agencies, with the banks collating all the sub-prime mortgages under AAA packages. Charlie Geller and Jamie Shipley, who are minor players in a $30 million start-up garage company called Brownfield, get a hold of Vennett's prospectus on the matter. Wanting in on the action but not having the official clout to play, they decide to call an old ""friend"", retired investment banker Ben Rickert, to help out. All three of these groups work on the premise that the banks are stupid and don't know what's going on, while for them to win, the general economy has to lose, which means the suffering of the general investor who trusts the financial institutions. That latter aspect may not sit well with Baum. Some of these assumptions may be incorrect and may be far more manipulative than they could have ever imagined, which in turn may throw curves into the process. Based on the book by Michael Lewis (writer of Moneyball, Liar's Poker and Flash Boys, among others), the true story of a handful of investors who bet against the US mortgage market in 2006-7. Through their own research they discovered that the US mortgage backed securities market was a bubble about to burst, and they invested accordingly. What they didn't initially know was how structurally flawed the MBS system was, the level of corruption in the market...and the impact on the average person when the bubble burst. In 2008, Wall Street guru Michael Burry realizes that a number of subprime home loans are in danger of defaulting. Burry bets against the housing market by throwing more than $1 billion of his investors' money into credit default swaps. His actions attract the attention of banker Jared Vennett, hedge-fund specialist Mark Baum and other greedy opportunists. Together, these men make a fortune by taking full advantage of the impending economic collapse in America. Based on the true story of four outsiders who saw what the big banks, media and government refused to: the global collapse of the economy. A bold investment leads them into the dark underbelly of banking, where everyone and everything is in question. Four denizens in the world of high-finance predict the credit and housing bubble collapse of the mid-2000s, and decide to take on the big banks for their greed and lack of foresight.",1895587|3682448|2381111|3170832|1663202|2402927|3460252|2446980|2080374|0810819|3203606|1392190

Each mystery is current and unusual and involves the group stopping someone from wreaking certain havoc on the world.

Their (unintended) destination turns out to be suffering a monster problem, and the gang volunteers to investigate the case. Eventually, enough clues are found to convince the gang that the ghost or monster was a villain. Invariably, the ghost or monster was apprehended and revealed to be an apparently blameless authority figure or otherwise innocuous local who uses the disguise to cover up a crime or scam.

This is the jumping-off point for a disturbing, well-researched and beautifully made cri de coeur from husband and wife team Dereck and Beverly Joubert, award-winning filmmakers from Botswana who have been Explorers-in-Residence at National Geographic for more than four years. Pointing to poaching as a primary threat while noting the lion's pride of place on the list for eco-tourists-an industry that brings in 200 billion dollars per year worldwide-the Jouberts build a solid case for both the moral duty we have to protect lions (as well as other threatened ""big cats,"" tigers among them) and the economic sense such protection would make. And when one takes into account the fact that big cats are at the very top of the food chain-and that their elimination would wreak havoc on all species below them, causing a complete ecosystem collapse-the need takes on a supreme urgency.",0047803|1618421|0185007|0488508|1014762|4397052|0363908|1865505|1564058|0012349|0397313|0109279

Among the players are: the Caucasian district attorney, who uses race as a political card; his Caucasian wife, who, having recently been carjacked by two black men, believes that her stereotypical views of non-whites is justified and cannot be considered racism; the two black carjackers who use their race both to their advantage and as an excuse; partnered Caucasian police constables, one who is a racist and uses his authority to harass non-whites, and the other who hates his partner because of those racist views, but who may have the same underlying values in his subconscious; a black film director and his black wife, who believes her husband doesn't support their black background enough, especially in light of an incident with the racist white cop; partnered police detectives and sometimes lovers, one Hispanic female and the other black male, the latter who is dealing with a drugged out mother that feels he isn't concerned enough about taking care of family; an East Asian man who is run over but who is hiding some valuable cargo in the back of his van; a Persian store owner, who feels he isn't getting satisfaction from American society when his store is robbed time and time again; and a Hispanic locksmith, who just wants to keep his family, especially his young daughter, safe in a seemingly unsafe world.

0096579,Family Matters,"The Winslow family is a pretty normal family except for one thing, their neighbor Stephen Urkel. A genius and klutz Steve makes some really weird inventions while driving the Winslow's insane. Originally, ""Family Matters"" a spin-off series of the successful ""Perfect Strangers"" was conceived to focus on the Winslows, a middle-class suburban Chicago black family. Harriet was the sarcastic elevator operator at the Chicago Chronicle newspaper while her portly husband, Carl, was a Chicago police sergeant; they had three children Eddie (14), Laura (12) and Judy (9). While somewhat successful in its early months on the air, ""Family Matters"" didn't become a true hit until the appearance of the Winslow's next door neighbor kid, Steve Urkel. The bespectacled Urkel, complete with high-pitched voice and suspenders, was the ultimate nerd who had an unrequited crush on Laura. His well-meaning but clumsy ways, in addition to countless back-firing contraptions and visits at inopportune times, caused no end of grief for Eddie, Laura and especially Carl; Harriet, however, was more understanding. Also a part of the action were Harriet's recently widowed sister, Rachel Crawford (she operated a local hangout, Rachel's Place), and her son, Richie; Carl's mother, Estelle; Eddie's slow-witted pal, Waldo; Laura's friend, MAXINE; and Myra Monkhouse, a beautiful teen-ager with a huge crush for Urkel. As the years went on, Urkel developed a special transformation chamber to allow himself to change into suave Stefan Urquelle, whom Laura fell for; it was a way for the nerd to finally win the object of his affection. Laura eventually got to appreciate Urkel's company, and eventually, fell in love with him. Carl was eventually promoted from sergeant to lieutenant, finally attaining the rank of captain. In later years, Urkel moved in with the Winslows (when his parents abandoned him in moving to Russia); and Carl and Harriet (long after their daughter, Judy, disappeared from the scene without explanation) adopted 3J, a local orphan who was friends with Richie. While many episodes seemed to focus on Urkel and Carl, a number of shows explored serious topics, including gangs, police brutality, teen-age drinking and guns in school. The show ran on ABC from 1989 through 1997 as a cornerstone of that network's ""TGIF"" programming block; it and ""Step by Step,"" another ""TGIF"" series, switched to CBS for both series' final season. Long-running ""Perfect Strangers"" spin-off series centering on the Winslow family and their pesky next-door neighbor, ultra-nerd Steve Urkel.",0101120|0086687|0092359|0086827|0105958|0088527|0090390|0108927|0090501|0083413|0115341|0077003

There are many sub-plots as the flyers jockey for position and the affections of various women. It's 1910, and flying has become all the rage, as it, as an activity, is still in its infancy. Despite not being a flying enthusiast himself, Lord Rawnsley, owner of the Daily Post newspaper, organizes a London to Paris flying race in order to boost circulation and show Britain's superiority as he expects who he assumes will eventually be his son-in-law, Richard Mays, will win the race. Richard suggested the race to begin with in order to bring together all the best aviator minds to advance the issue of flying machine design. Richard's unofficial intended, Patricia Rawnsley, is secretly adventurous in nature and wants more than anything to be able to fly, and does whatever she can, against her father's wishes, to be one of those in the air. News of the race goes global, with entries from all over the world. As such, the race does become a competition for national pride and of the most adventurous, as flying more than five miles is still considered an accomplishment, let alone needing to traverse the twenty-two mile distance across the English Channel between Dover and Calais. But it also becomes a competition for Patricia's affections, as one of the entrants is American cowboy Orvil Newton, who is immediately attracted to Patricia and who may be able to give her that flight that she so much wants, which Richard seems unwilling to do as not to get on the wrong side of his future father-in-law.

At this point the story turns into the animated version and Dickens explains that the mouse, named Gabriel, carries a glimmer of hope amidst the glaring co-existence of rich and poor in the streets of London. Throughout the subsequent unfolding of the well-known story Gabriel acts as a miniature Greek chorus, providing younger members of the audience with a point of entry into the story and, in the case of the potentially frightening elements (the Ghosts of Past, Present and Future), a place of refuge.",0068373|0429589|0087056|1067106|0495818|2315500|0455499|0110763|0233691|0375568|0029992|0158811

The six children not only have their usual issues in growing from children to teenagers, and in this situation in getting used to a new parent and new siblings, but also interacting with new siblings whose mentality generally reflects their specific gender, which more often than not is totally foreign to them.

When he is pursued by men who want to kill him, he goes to the American Consulate where he knows he will be arrested. When the CIA learns of this, it's decided to bring him to a safe house in Capetown, where they will interrogate him. Shortly after they arrive, the men who chased Frost storm the safe house and kill everyone there. Matt Weston, the agent who's tasked with looking after the safe house, is the only one left, so he takes Frost and they go on the run. While on the run, Frost tells Weston that the only way those men found the safe house was that someone (on the inside) told them about it. Eventually Frost escapes and Weston is told to report to Langley but just as he's about to go there, he recalls something that Frost did that helps him figure out where he could be going. But just as he arrives, the men who are after Frost show up but Weston saves him and they head off. But Weston knows that Frost is holding something back. Weston is a low-ranking CIA operative who happens upon the biggest mission of his career when a former high-ranking CIA agent Frost becomes his ""house guest"". It is only a matter of time before Weston realizes that there is a huge conspiracy going on and that no one is safe. In Cape Town, South Aftica, rookie CIA agent Matt Weston is a safe house keeper and is in love with his French girlfriend Ana Moreau who does not know about his double life. When the most wanted rogue and former CIA agent Tobin Frost surrenders to the American Consulate to escape from an attack of dangerous soldiers of fortune, he is brought to the safe house to be interrogated by specialist Daniel Kiefer and his team. However there is a breach in the safe house and mercenaries break in the place expecting to capture Tobin Frost. Matt escapes with Tobin and he contacts the CIA senior management Harlan Whitford, David Barlow and Catherine Linklater that give instruction to Matt to reach another safe house. But Tobin warns Matt that there is an informer in the CIA and he shall not trust in anyone.

Weston's job is to protect his house guests at all cost. Out of circumstance, Weston and Frost are forced to go on the run from the house, largely without the help of anyone else within the agency, including those at Langley such as Weston's boss David Barlow, Barlow's peer Catherine Linklater who is in charge of the section interrogating Frost, and their superior Deputy Director Harlan Whitford, that is until they are able to give him further instructions. Weston's task is difficult as they are being pursued by some men who are after Frost for some reason and are willing to kill, and Frost is largely an unwilling companion, who tries to undermine Weston, particularly psychologically, and escape at every opportunity. Weston has no idea why Frost came in, something those at Langley are trying to determine. Weston knows his career is on the line if he fails in the mission, that is if he survives. During the process, Weston is continually thinking about his girlfriend, French national Ana Moreau, to who he lied about his job, and thus whose life may be in danger without her even knowing it or ever knowing why it may have been in danger. A young CIA agent is tasked with looking after a fugitive in a safe house.

0204824,Animal Farm,"A satire of Stalinist Russia, Animal Farm tells of the revolt of the animals of Manor Farm against their human masters. Led by the pigs Snowball (Lenin) and Napoleon (Stalin), the animals attempt to create a utopian society. Soon, however, Napoleon gets a taste for power, drives out Snowball, and establishes a totalitarian regime as brutal and corrupt as any human society. Manor Farm becomes a world where all animals are equal--but some are more equal than others. A direct allegory to the rise of Stalinist Russia, this film combines Orwells parable with animatronics and voice characterizations by popular actors. Following a speech made by a venerable pig named Old Major (Lenin), the animals of Manor Farm form their own philosophy of Animalism (Communism), and lead a successful revolution orchestrated primarily by the pig Snowball (Trotsky) who tries to implement Old Majors ideas to the letter. Snowballs idealism does not save him when he is exiled by a more ambitious pig named Napoleon (Stalin) who seizes power over the farm, and proceeds to reshape Old Majors ideas to his own liking, and bringing the animals into a darker existence than they had ever dreamed. Film adaptation of George Orwell's novel, an allegory of Russian Communism. The animal inhibitants of an English farm, spurred on by dreams of dominating the earth and ruling together and equally, take over, and at first all is well. But then Napolean the pig decides he wants a little more power. He ousts his opponent, Snowball, and turns the farm into a corrupt society, assuring the animals that everything is fine, when in fact that is most certainly not true. The animals of a farm successfully revolt against its human owner, only to slide into a more brutal tyranny among themselves.",0348124|0027468|0115491|0119918|0272388|0107131|0086590|0312004|0046008|0086829|0107952|3914482

In the waiting room of an abortion clinic, the quirky and whip-sharp Juno decides to give birth and to place the child with an adoptive couple. She finds one in the PennySaver personals, contacts them, tells her dad and step-mother, and carries on with school. The chosen parents, upscale yuppies (one of whom is cool and laid back, the other meticulous and uptight), meet Juno, sign papers, and the year unfolds. Will Juno's plan work, can she improvise, and what about Bleeker? Sixteen year-old Juno MacGuff is the type of girl that beats to her own drummer, and doesn't really care what others may think of her. She learns that she's pregnant from a one-time sexual encounter with her best friend, Paulie Bleeker. Juno and Paulie like each other, but don't consider themselves to be exclusive boyfriend/girlfriend let alone be ready to be a family complete with child. Although she would rather not be pregnant, Juno is fairly pragmatic about her situation. Although there, Paulie really leaves all the decisions about the baby to Juno. Initially she decides that she will have an abortion, but that's something that she ultimately cannot go through with. So she decides to have the baby and give it up for adoption. But first she has to tell her father, Mac, and stepmother, Bren, that she is pregnant. Although they would have preferred if Juno was on hard drugs or expelled from school, Mac and Bren too are pragmatic about Juno's situation. The next step is to find prospective parents for the yet unborn child. In the Pennysaver ad section, Juno finds Mark and Vanessa Loring, a yuppie couple living in the suburbs. Juno likes the Lorings, and in some respects has found who looks to be a kindred spirit in Mark, with whom she shares a love of grunge music and horror films. Vanessa is a little more uptight and is the one in the relationship seemingly most eager to have a baby. On her own choosing, Juno enters into a closed rather than open adoption contract with the Lorings - meaning she will have no contact with the baby after she gives it up. During the second and third trimesters of Juno's pregnancy which she treats with care but detachment, Juno's relationships with her family, with Paulie, and with the Lorings develop, the latter whose on the surface perfect life masks some hidden problems.

The Aviator ends in 1946, when Hughes was still a dashing young man and romancing actresses like Ava Gardner and Katharine Hepburn. Phenomenal public success contrasts with private behaviors close to madness: Howard Hughes from the late 1920s to the late 1940s, from ""Hells Angels"" (spending a fortune on details) through the only flight of the Hercules, a huge, money-losing transport plane. Along the way, the public Hughes sees the big picture - in movies and in aviation, building TWA and leading it through a fight with Pan Am and the US Senate. In private, phobias and compulsions threaten him with self-imposed solitary confinement. How long can his imagination, drive, and the sympathies of Katharine Hepburn, Ava Gardner, and the men who work for him stave off these internal disorders? Focusing on his early years (from the 1930 production of 'Hell's Angels' to the 1947 test flight of the Spruce Goose, when he was 42), this is the story of how young Howard Hughes transformed a small fortune into a massive one. The son of the Texan inventor of an amazing drill bit who died when he was 18, leaving him with 75% of the ""Hughes Tool Co."", Howard Hughes quickly moved to Los Angeles to become a Hollywood film producer, where he helped launch the career of Jean Harlow and other starlets, and producing such classics as Hell's Angels, The Front Page, Flying Leathernecks, and Scarface (the 1932 original), eventually owning RKO Pictures. Hughes' legend came not from focusing on just Hollywood, however, as he simultaneously branched into industry after industry, including aviation in 1932 (including TWA Airlines), and during WWII, defense, leading to the creation of the (infamous) Spruce Goose, a flying boat of immense size. After WWII, Hughes' expansions continued, with an electronics company that was integral to the evolution of the satellite, and Hughes' several Las Vegas casinos (though this film may be ending before he moves there). This film will also focus on Hughes' romances with Hollywood stars like Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner. A biopic depicting the early years of legendary director and aviator",0217505|0450259|0264464|1343092|0163978|1616195|0758774|0120744|0959337|0117509|0388789|0407887

Over time, he is deeply affected by the treatment of Jews and begins to take steps to protect the 1500 or so people who work for him. He convinces the authorities to build a new factory where the employees are interned and goes out of his way to hire those who face the wrath of the camp commandant, Amon G?th.

The deceased partner was in his lifetime as mean and miserly as Scrooge is now and he warns him to change his ways or face the consequences in the afterlife. Scrooge dismisses the apparition but the first of the three ghosts, the Ghost of Christmas Past, visits as promised.

The Ghost of Christmas yet to Come shows him how he will be remembered once he is gone. To his delight, the spirits complete their visits in one night giving him the opportunity to mend his ways. In the Nineteenth Century, in London, the bitter, greedy and cranky Ebenezer Scrooge hates Christmas and people. He runs his business exploiting his employee Bob Cratchit and spends unfriendly treatment to his nephew Fred and acquaintances.

Scrooge finds that life is good and finds redemption changing thoughts about Christmas, Bob, tiny Tim, his nephew and people in general.

He is told that he can expect visitations from 3 ghosts, to which Scrooge ""humbugs.""

0343818,"I, Robot","Set in a future Earth (2035 A.D.) where robots are common assistants and workers for their human owners, this is the story of ""robotophobic"" Chicago Police Detective Del Spooner's investigation into the murder of Dr. Alfred Lanning, who works at U.S. Robotics, in which a robot, Sonny , appears to be implicated, even though that would mean the robot had violated the Three Laws of Robotics, which is apparently impossible. It seems impossible because.. if robots can break those laws, there's nothing to stop them from taking over the world, as humans have grown to become completely dependent upon their robots. Or maybe... they already have? Aiding Spooner in his investigation is a psychologist, Dr. Susan Calvin, who specializes in the psyches of robots. This is the year 2035. Everybody in the world relies on a huge system of robots, which are programmed specifically to help humans and not harm them in any way. But one person does not think that robots are helpful. Chicago homicide detective Del Spooner. But one day, he received a call from the United States Robotics (USR) about a recent death of renowned robot scientist Dr. Alfred J. Laning. Spooner immediately blamed this incident on robots without justifiable reason or proof. Then, he begins his investigation on Lanning's death, only to discover Sonny, a ""unique"" robot. What Spooner does not realize, is that something is about to happen. Something that is beyond even Spooner's wildest dreams. It's the year 2035, and the society now has the help of robots. These robots follow three laws integrated into their system; 1) They cannot harm a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. 2)They must do whatever they're told by a human being as long as such orders don't conflict with law one. 3) They have to defend themselves as long as such defense doesn't conflict with laws one or two. One day, the writer of the three laws, Alfred Lanning, apparently jumps out of a window at U.S. Robotics. The majority of the Chicago Police Department believe he committed suicide, but Detective Del Spooner, who hates robots, thinks he was murdered, and the number one suspect is a robot who calls himself Sonny. However, if it was Sonny, then it means he would've had to have broken the three laws. With the help of Dr. Susan Calvin, Spooner must now discover the truth before it's too late. It's 2035 A.D., where robots are everyday objects and are programmed to live alongside humans. Detective Del Spooner is called out to investigate the apparent suicide of the scientist behind these robots, Dr. Alfred Lanning. Spooner suspects that the death might not be a suicide, but the result of one of the robots. All robots are programmed by three laws, but Spooner starts to wonder if a robot can in fact feel emotions, and possibly murder. But if Spooner's suspicions are true, he is going to have a hard time convincing everyone. In 2035 a technophobic cop investigates a crime that may have been perpetrated by a robot, which leads to a larger threat to humanity.",0480249|0448157|0119654|0120912|1409024|0116629|0416449|0418279|0145487|0988045|0319262|1318514

0416449,300,"In the Battle of Thermopylae of 480 BC an alliance of Greek city-states fought the invading Persian army in the mountain pass of Thermopylae. Vastly outnumbered, the Greeks held back the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. Persian King Xerxes lead a Army of well over 100,000 (Persian king Xerxes before war has about 170,000 army) men to Greece and was confronted by 300 Spartans, and several hundred Arcadians. Xerxes waited for 10 days for King Leonidas to surrender or withdraw left with no options he moved. The battle lasted for about 3 days and after which all 300 Spartans were killed. The Spartan defeat was not the one expected, as a local shepherd, named Ephialtes, defected to the Persians and informed Xerxes of a separate path through Thermopylae, which the Persians could use to outflank the Greeks. 300 tells the story of the Battle of Thermopylae in 480 B.C. Persians under the rule of King Xerxes have already taken over some of the Hellenic city-states, and now threaten Sparta and Athens. King Leonidas of Sparta is left with two options: he will either have to sacrifice himself for the well-being of Sparta or watch it burn to the ground. Choosing the former, Leonidas forms an army of 300 Spartan warriors to block the narrow passage of Thermopylae where Xerxes intends to reach Hellas. The 300 are accompanied by about 700 Thespians who protect the flanks of the passage, and combined, the forces manage to slay tens of thousands of Persians and prevent their entry into Hellas for several days. However, Ephialtes, a reject of the Spartan Army gets his revenge by showing Xerxes a secret goat passage up the flanks of the passage. The story depicts the epic last stand of the finest Spartan soldiers who are aware of their fate, but motivated by ""honor and glory"", see the battle as their duty to protect the rest of Greece for as long as possible. In 480 BC, the Persian king Xerxes sends his massive army to conquer Greece. The Greek city of Sparta houses its finest warriors, and 300 of these soldiers are chosen to meet the Persians at Thermopylae, engaging the soldiers in a narrow canyon where they cannot take full advantage of their numbers. The battle is a suicide mission, meant to buy time for the rest of the Greek forces to prepare for the invasion. However, that doesn't stop the Spartans from throwing their hearts into the fray, determined to take as many Persians as possible with them. When the ambitious King Xerxes of Persia invades Greece with his huge army to extend his vast slave empire, the brave Ling Leonidas brings his personal body guard army composed of three hundred warriors to defend the passage of Thermopylae, the only way by land to reach Greece. Using courage and the great battle skill of his men, he defends Thermopylae until a treacherous Greek citizen tells King Xerxes a secret goat passage leading to the back of Leonidas's army. Meanwhile, his wife Queen Gorgo of Sparta tries to convince the council to send the Spartan army to fight against the Persians.

0059243,The Great Race,"Professional daredevil and white-suited hero, The Great Leslie, convinces turn-of-the-century auto makers that a race from New York to Paris (westward across America, the Bering Straight and Russia) will help to promote automobile sales. Leslie's arch-rival, the mustached and black-attired Professor Fate vows to beat Leslie to the finish line in a car of Fate's own invention. The Blake Edwards style of slapstick and song originated with this movie. A dedication to Laurel and Hardy appears at the beginning of the film. Edwards' tribute to Stan and Ollie can be seen most clearly in the interaction between Professor Fate and his cohort Max, as well as in the operatic Pottsdorf pie fight. In the early twentieth century, the Great Leslie - daredevil and all 'round Renaissance man always clad in white - has several world records to his name in daring feats of courage, always with the faithful Hezekiah by his side. Leslie's arch enemy is the dastardly Professor Fate - always clad in black - who is always trying either to outdo Leslie or thwart Leslie's attempts of daring, without success. Leslie suggests to the Webber Motor Car Company that they show their engineering expertise by building the supreme motor car for a New York to Paris race, that car which they ultimately name the Leslie Special after their inspiration. Not to be outdone, Fate, with his equally dastardly sidekick Max, also enters the race with what he considers his motor car masterpiece, the Hannibal Twin-8. Nothing is too dastardly an act in Fate's goal of winning. One of the other entries is the beautiful Maggie Dubois, a reporter covering the race for the New York Sentinel newspaper. An emancipated woman, Maggie initially tried to convince both Leslie and Fate to use her as their driving partner, both who refused, considering her among the weaker sex. Maggie however convinced the newspaper both to hire her and to sponsor their own car with her as the driver based on the internal struggle within the newspaper's ownership, which is similar to Maggie's own struggles. Maggie expects to win: in her logic, she is covering the entire race (which she does with the use of some primitive but effective technology), meaning she needs to be first at the finish line. Despite being emancipated, Maggie is not averse to using her feminine wiles to her advantage. Through the race, they come across a few adventures and obstacles. But being a long race with much interaction between the racers, their mindsets and priorities may change based on their time together. When a popular daredevil proposes an automobile race across three continents, his arch rival vows to beat him, while an ambitious female reporter has her own plans for victory.",0059797|0048960|0064603|0051745|0046672|0052948|0049096|0058385|0060397|0034522|0062803|0056255

As imminent conflict brews between the powerful Trade Federation and the peaceful planet of Naboo, Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi travel to Naboo to warn the Queen of the galactic fallout which is to follow. Eventually, Naboo is invaded forcing the Jedi to evacuate the planet with the Queen and her court. They travel to the desert planet of Tatooine where they meet a slave boy named Anakin Skywalker who is evidently one with the Force. They enlist his help in fighting the war, while the Jedi confront one of the Dark Jedi behind the invasion, Darth Maul, while his master Darth Sidious continues to lead the invasion as a ""phantom"" behind the scenes. It is a distant galaxy eons before the gestation of the planet Earth. Advancements in technology and science have allowed the evolution of millions of worlds that are otherwise in many respects still primitive. These worlds are somewhat loosely allied into a galactic Republic, whose capital world is the planet Coruscant, a planetary city. Upholding order for the Republic are the Jedi, an order of warriors endowed with near-super power derived from self-generated fields of energy known collectively as the Force. Within the Republic, dissident worlds have banded into an alliance known as the Trade Federation, and the Trade Federation is locked in a dispute with the peaceful world of Naboo. Two Jedi Knights, Qui-Gon Jinn and his youthful apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, have been sent to Naboo to help mediate an end to the dispute, but Nute Gunray, an alien viceroy, orders them to be killed, and the two Jedi discover upon their escape that the Trade Federation will launch an invasion of Naboo. With the help of a well-meaning but hopelessly subliterate alien native of Naboo, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan land on Naboo to rescue her ruler, Queen Amidala, a ruler whose rule is a mixture of monarchy and republican democracy. Escaping Naboo, they are attacked by a Federation baseship and are forced to land on the distant planet Tatooine, where in seeking parts to complete their journey to Coruscant they encounter a young boy, Anakin Skywalker, a slave who possesses a gift for the savagely dangerous sport of podracing - a gift that Qui-Gon deduces is part of a genetic makeup perfect for the Jedi Order. Anakin eventually joins with Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan, and in the process attracts the attention of one of Queen Amidala's handmaidens with a dramatic secret, and all reach Coruscant, but endless and pointless debate within the Republic's Senate leave them no choice but to strike out on their own to liberate Naboo, a task made all the more difficult because a traitor within Coruscant has at his command a dissident Jedi warrior who seeks the death of Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan. Two Jedi Knights escape a hostile blockade to find allies and come across a young boy who may bring balance to the Force, but the long dormant Sith resurface to reclaim their old glory.",0121765|0121766|0086190|0080684|0076759|0383574|0087469|0096874|0099088|0145487|0449088|0371746

0361748,Inglourious Basterds,"In Nazi-occupied France, young Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfus witnesses the slaughter of her family by Colonel Hans Landa. Narrowly escaping with her life, she plots her revenge several years later when German war hero Fredrick Zoller takes a rapid interest in her and arranges an illustrious movie premiere at the theater she now runs. With the promise of every major Nazi officer in attendance, the event catches the attention of the ""Basterds"", a group of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers led by the ruthless Lt. Aldo Raine. As the relentless executioners advance and the conspiring young girl's plans are set in motion, their paths will cross for a fateful evening that will shake the very annals of history. During World War II a group of American soldiers are sent into Europe to kill Nazis. They've become so good at it that the Germans refer to them as The Basterds. Later, they work with a British officer who was sent to formalize a plan to kill several high ranking German officers at the premiere of a movie depicting the ""heroics"" of a German soldier. But something goes wrong at the meeting with their contact, a German actress, all of the members of the team who speak German are killed which complicates the plans. So the leader Lt. Raine comes up with an alternative. And another complication is the screening is being moved to a small theater because the man depicted in the movie takes a liking to the owner of the theater. And unknown to them, she is a Jew whose entire family was killed by a Nazi officer, who was tasked with rounding up the Jews and is now the security officer of the screening. And also unknown is that she has her own plans. It's WWII, the battleground, Nazi-occupied France. The Nazis are doing whatever they need to to flush out and exterminate Jews, the most proficient and prolific of the Jew hunters being the sadistic SS Colonel Hans Landa. As such, the American military forms a unit, led by Lieutenant Aldo Raine and comprised of eight Jews, to kill as many Nazis as possible. Raine requests each of his men to bring him the scalp of at least 100 Nazis apiece. He has his own method of ensuring that those Nazis he does allow or need to let go free are scarred for life. In Paris in 1944, Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi's chief propaganda master and filmmaker, plans to debut his latest film, ""Nation's Pride"". The film, based on the victorious military exploits of Private Fredrick Zoller, stars Zoller as himself. Because of his attraction to its pretty proprietress Emmanuelle Mimieux, Zoller convinces Goebbels and the Nazi brass to hold the premiere at Mimieux's cinema. Landa is to act as chief of security for the event. When the Americans get wind of the screening and the fact that most of the Nazi highers-up will be in attendance, Raine's team is tasked with blowing up the cinema during the screening. They are assisted by renowned German actress, Bridget von Hammersmark, who has been working as a spy for the British. They believe luck is on their side when they learn that Hitler himself is scheduled to attend. Beyond being found out, Raine's team face two as of yet unknown issues. The first is Mimieux, who is really Shoshanna Dreyfus, a Jew who saw her family brutally murdered by Landa four years earlier, and who may have her own plans for Landa and the Nazis. The second is Landa, who beyond his up front mission, has another more personal mission for his life post-war unknown to anyone but himself. A team of jewish american soldiers, are tasked to kill Adolf Hitler. But in Nazi-occupied France a young woman who escaped the slaughter of her entire jewish family, is trying to figure out a way to kill Hitler and most of all a brutal Nazi Colonel. During World War II, Lt. Aldo Raine leads his squad of Jewish-American soldiers behind enemy lines in Nazi occupied France. Their job is simple: kill the enemy. They also have a particularly violent approach to what they do scalping their victims. Soon they are known and feared throughout the German army. In Paris, Shosanna runs a cinema and through a chance meeting with a German war hero, is selected to host the premiere of one of Dr. Josef Goebbels propaganda film. With all of the German high command scheduled to attend - including Hitler, Goering and Martin Bormann - it seems like the ideal opportunity for Lt. Raine and his men to bring the war to a quick end.

When she realizes that the man who killed her family Colonel Hans Landa, known as the Jew Hunter, will also be there it makes her own plans complete.

1205489,Gran Torino,"Walt Kowalski is a widower who holds onto his prejudices despite the changes in his Michigan neighborhood and the world around him. Kowalski is a grumpy, tough-minded, unhappy old man who can't get along with either his kids or his neighbors. He is a Korean War veteran whose prize possession is a 1972 Gran Torino he keeps in mint condition. When his neighbor Thao, a young Hmong teenager under pressure from his gang member cousin, tries to steal his Gran Torino, Kowalski sets out to reform the youth. Drawn against his will into the life of Thao's family, Kowalski is soon taking steps to protect them from the gangs that infest their neighborhood. Walt Kowalski is an embittered Korean War veteran who has just lost his wife. The world has changed around him as well. His once all-white neighborhood is now mostly Southeast Asian and he has a Hmong family living next door. He doesn't get along with his sons and is out of touch with his grandchildren, all of whom seem more interested in getting his house than anything else. His pride and joy, however, is his mint condition 1972 Gran Torino. When the Hmong teenager who lives next door, Thao, is challenged by his cousin and other local gang members to steal it, Walt almost shoots him. Gradually, however, he realizes he has more in common with his neighbors than his own family and becomes something of a neighborhood hero when he prevents the gangbangers from forcing Thao into their car. He gradually takes Thao under his wing, teaching him a few things about life and helps getting him a job. Walt's intervention has a price, however, when the gang shoots up Thao's house and attack his sister Sue. For Walt, it's time to take action, though not in a way you would expect. Walt Kowalski is a retired auto worker and Korean War veteran living in Detroit. Recently widowed, Walt lives alone with his dog in a crime-infested neighborhood and has a strained relationship with his family. A Hmong family moves next door to Walt but he wants nothing to do with them. One night, one of the members of the family, Thao, is coaxed by his cousin 'Spider', a gang member, to steal Walt's prized Gran Torino. Thao botches the theft after getting caught by Walt. However, the duo reluctantly start a friendship as Walt seeks to straighten out Thao. As Walt's relationship with Thao extends to Thao's family, Walt is forced to defend them from Spider and his gang who begin to routinely attack Thao and his family. Elderly Walt Kowalski is recently widowed. Much of Walt's views of life are shaped by his time in the Korean War. On strained relations with his grown sons and not wanting the advice of the priest of his wife's church, Walt is a gruff man who has few friends. As such, he lives a solitary life with his pet Labrador retriever Daisy in the same house he has lived in for years, which is located in a working class Highland Park, Michigan neighborhood. Recently, the neighborhood has gone through changes where it is now racially mixed. The Lor family, of ethnic Hmong descent, move into the house next door to Walt's, the family which includes two teenagers, streetwise Sue and shy Thao. Initially Walt wants nothing to do with his new foreign neighbors. Slowly, Walt does get involved in Sue and Thao's lives, despite Thao having once tried to steal Walt's beloved 1972 Gran Torino. That attempted theft was a Hmong gang initiation ritual, a gang to which Thao does not want to belong. Walt sees that Sue and Thao will never be able to live in peace as long as that gang exists. As his teen-aged neighbors' unofficial protector, Walt has to figure out how best to restore his sense of right in the neighborhood. In Michigan, the grumpy widower Walt Kowalski is a Korean War veteran full of prejudice that has just lost his beloved wife Dorothy. He is one of the last Caucasian Americans in his neighborhood and does not have good relationship with his sons and their families; therefore he is a lonely man. When his teenager neighbor Thao Vang Lor is pressed by his cousin Smokie to join his Hmong gang, he is assigned to steal the Gran Torino of Walt as part of his initiation in the gang. However, he is surprised by the old man and his traditional family feels ashamed with the incident. Later Walt saves Thao first and his sister Sue Lor from gangs and he has the gratitude of his next door neighbors and the neighborhood. On the day of his birthday, Walt is invited by Sue to join her family reunion and he begins a relationship with his neighbors, helping Thao to get a job. However, he realizes that the Hmong gang disturbs the neighborhood and after a coward attack of the gangster, Walt decides to take an ultimate attitude.

0482571,The Prestige,"In the end of the Nineteenth Century, in London, Robert Angier, his beloved wife Julia McCullough and Alfred Borden are friends and assistants of a magician. When Julia accidentally dies during a performance, Robert blames Alfred for her death and they become enemies. Both become famous and rival magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage. When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences. Set in London in the 1800's, two rival magicians read each others diary containing the secrets of their magic tricks and personal life. As we go back in time when the diaries were written, both magicians become obsessed with their rival's best trick. The tricks, as shown to the audience, look the same, but neither magician can figure out how his opponent does it. Two magicians who used to be partners' battle over years in order to create a flawless method for the ultimate disappearing trick, ""the Transported Man"", turns into an informal war between them and soon, they will do anything to be able to preform the trick sooner and better than the other; which as time passes makes their friends and loved ones get away from them and little-by-little destroys their lives until they eventually succeed to preform the trick- each by a very different way. In Victorian London, illusionist Alfred Borden is on trial for the murder of fellow illusionist Robert Angier. Borden's indictment is largely possible because of the eyewitness account of John Cutter, who saw Borden backstage in the area where Angier was killed. At the end of one of his shows, Angier fell through a trap door in the stage floor into a clear water-filled tank below, that tank which is a prop for one of Angier's tricks performed earlier in the show. Angier ended up drowning as the tank was locked after he fell into it. Borden, Angier and Cutter have a shared largely turbulent history, which also provides motive. Early in their magic careers, both Borden and Angier worked under ""Milton the Magician"", while Angier's wife Julia worked as his on-stage assistant, and Cutter as his ing?nieur - staging the tricks and providing the apparatus required - work that he still does for others. Based on a specific incident during this stage of their relationship led to both Borden and Angier striking out creating their own shows and they having a feud which was not only in the professional realm but a personal one, where each man wanted to ruin the other. While Borden is arguably more accomplished in the technical aspects of the illusions, Angier is the more accomplished showman. In the professional realm, they tried to outdo each other, especially in the illusions considered either the most dangerous and/or mysterious, those two being catching the shot bullet trick, and more so the transported man trick. In the process of their feud, they seemingly were not averse to any means, even with collateral damage of others. The question is if those means extend to murder, especially of the other. A mysterious story of two magicians whose intense rivalry leads them on a life-long battle for supremacy -- full of obsession, deceit and jealousy with dangerous and deadly consequences. From the time that they first met as young magicians on the rise, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden were competitors. However, their friendly competition evolves into a bitter rivalry making them fierce enemies-for-life and consequently jeopardizing the lives of everyone around them. Set against the backdrop of turn-of-the-century London. Two stage magicians engage in competitive one-upmanship in an attempt to create the ultimate stage illusion.",0209144|1130884|0114369|0407887|1375666|0172495|0137523|0109830|0120689|1345836|0133093|0372784

He has always longed to travel but never had the opportunity in order to prevent rich skinflint Mr. Potter from taking over the entire town. All that prevents him from doing so is George's modest building and loan company, which was founded by his generous father. But on Christmas Eve, George's Uncle Billy loses the business's $8,000 while intending to deposit it in the bank. Potter finds the misplaced money and hides it from Billy. When the bank examiner discovers the shortage later that night, George realizes that he will be held responsible and sent to jail and the company will collapse, finally allowing Potter to take over the town. Thinking of his wife, their young children, and others he loves will be better off with him dead, he contemplates suicide. But the prayers of his loved ones result in a gentle angel named Clarence coming to earth to help George, with the promise of earning his wings. He shows George what things would have been like if he had never been born. In a nightmarish vision in which the Potter-controlled town is sunk in sex and sin, those George loves are either dead, ruined, or miserable. He realizes that he has touched many people in a positive way and that his life has truly been a wonderful one. A young George Bailey, overwhelmed by family obligations and a sense of responsibility toward his community, feels tied down to a company he never had an interest in working for, and a life he never wanted to live. As he ages, he sees his youth, dreams and opportunities pass him by. Unknown to George, all of his friends and family have been praying for him to get through those hard times. Told through the point of view of a group of angels, he is met by his guardian angel Clarence, as he contemplates ending his life.

George Bailey spends his entire life giving up his big dreams for the good of his town, Bedford Falls, as we see in flashback. But in the present, on Christmas Eve, he is broken and suicidal over the misplacing of an $8000 loan and the machinations of the evil millionaire Mr. Potter. His guardian angel, Clarence, falls to Earth, literally, and shows him how his town, family, and friends would have turned out if he had never been born. George meant so much to so many people; should he really throw it all away? On the Christmas Eve of Bedford Falls, the guardian angel Clarence is assigned to convince the desperate George Bailey not to commit suicide.

He inherited the loan business of his father and he gave up traveling the world and joining University as scheduled. Later he resisted the proposals of the evil banker Mr. Potter, and never sold his business to protect the poor community of Bedford Falls and offer a means to afford to buy their own house. He married his beloved Mary Hatch Bailey and had four children with her and a tough life with his family. When his uncle Billy loses US$ 8,000.00, found and stolen by Mr. Potter, George decides to commit suicide, since he believes he worth more dead than alive.

0093779,The Princess Bride,"An elderly man reads the book ""The Princess Bride"" to his sick and thus currently bedridden adolescent grandson, the reading of the book which has been passed down within the family for generations. The grandson is sure he won't like the story, with a romance at its core, he preferring something with lots of action and ""no kissing"". But the grandson is powerless to stop his grandfather, whose feelings he doesn't want to hurt. The story centers on Buttercup, a former farm girl who has been chosen as the princess bride to Prince Humperdinck of Florian. Buttercup does not love him, she who still laments the death of her one true love, Westley, five years ago. Westley was a hired hand on the farm, his stock answer of ""as you wish"" to any request she made of him which she came to understand was his way of saying that he loved her. But Westley went away to sea, only to be killed by the Dread Pirate Roberts. On a horse ride to clear her mind of her upcoming predicament of marriage, Buttercup is kidnapped by a band of bandits: Vizzini who works on his wits, and his two associates, a giant named Fezzik who works on his brawn, and a Spaniard named Inigo Montoya, who has trained himself his entire life to be an expert swordsman. They in turn are chased by the Dread Pirate Roberts himself. But chasing them all is the Prince, and his men led by Count Tyrone Rugen. What happens to these collectives is dependent partly on Buttercup, who does not want to marry the Prince, and may see other options as lesser evils, and partly on the other motives of individuals within the groups. But a larger question is what the grandson will think of the story as it proceeds and at its end, especially as he sees justice as high a priority as action. A kindly grandfather sits down with his ill grandson and reads him a story. The story is one that has been passed down from father to son for generations. As the grandfather reads the story, the action comes alive. The story is a classic tale of love and adventure as the beautiful Buttercup, engaged to the odious Prince Humperdinck, is kidnapped and held against her will in order to start a war, It is up to Westley (her childhood beau, now returned as the Dread Pirate Roberts) to save her. On the way he meets a thief and his hired helpers, an accomplished swordsman and a huge, super strong giant, both of whom become Westley's companions in his quest. When the lovely Buttercup is kidnapped by a ghastly gang intent on fermenting an international incident they find they are pursued by the Dread Pirate Roberts who just might be Westley, her one true love. Also after everyone is nasty Prince Humperdinck to whom Buttercup is now betrothed but who seems to care little for her continued survival. The stage is set for swordfights, monsters, and tortures - but will Grandpa be allowed to finish telling the story with all these kissy bits? Return to a time when men and swamps were swamps. Fire Swamps, that is. Full of quicksand and Rodents of Unusual Size. Lagoons were inhabited by shrieking eels. And the most beautiful woman in the world was named . . . Buttercup? Well, it's a bent fairy tale. Complete with all the fencing, chasing, escapes, and silly accents you'd expect. Including such unique folk as Inigo Montoya, who has dreamed his whole life of finding the six-fingered man who killed his father. Fezzik is his enormous sidekick. And Max is the kvetching miracle man. Blonde Buttercup loves Westley, a poor stable boy. But when he's captured by pirates, she's chosen by evil Prince Humperdinck to be his princess bride. Along the way, she gets kidnapped, he gets killed. But it all ends up okay. When a young boy falls ill, his grandfather pops round to visit him. To cheer his grandson up, Grandpa has brought a storybook; The Princess Bride, a tale of the love between the beautiful Buttercup and the besotted Westley, a love cruelly interrupted by Westley's tragic apparent death at sea when seeking his fortune. Heartbroken, Buttercup has sworn never to love again, but accepts the marriage proposal of the rich and handsome Prince Humperdinck, heir to the throne of Florin; but death is no barrier to true love, and in a story filled with exotically-accented swordsmen, big-hearted giants, genius kidnappers, sadistic torturers, vile swamps, Rodents of Unusual Size, the Dread Pirate Roberts and a somewhat embittered miracle worker, the love between Westley and Buttercup twists and turns on a path filled with adventure. Will the True Love of Westley and Buttercup win the day? Will Inigo Montaya find the six-fingered man who murdered his father? Will Humperdinck's evil plans come to fruition? And, more importantly, will Grandpa be able to tell the story without any of the yucky kissing?

0088527,Growing Pains,"It's hard enough to raise a kid nowadays but when you have to cope with THESE kids, things tend to get out of hand! Dr Seaver, a psychologist and his wife Maggie Seaver, a journalist, try to do their best raising their family and although their kids, Mike, Ben, Carol and Crissie, cause them endless problems, they manage to keep the family close together. As long as they got each other, nothing else matters... This ABC family sitcom revolved around the Seaver family, who lived on Long Island in New York. When the series debuted in 1985, Jason (a psychiatrist) and Maggie (a newspaper reporter) headed a family of three children: 15-year-old Mike, who was irresponsible and an academic slacker; 14-year-old Carol, the brainy nerd and a bit shy; and 9-year-old Ben, who idolized his brother. In the premiere, Jason moves his practice to his home when Maggie went back to work (for the Long Island Herald, using her maiden name, Maggie Malone, as her byline). Most of the stories revolved around standard family issues (such as the children getting into all kinds of situations), though there was time to explore serious topics such as vandalism, gangs and drug use. As the years wore on, the characters changed. Mike developed a love of acting (he had tried out for a play for the sole intent of trying to woo an attractive classmate, and found his hidden talent in the process); he later enrolled in a local college and began student teaching, while keeping his acting resume updated. Carol (slightly overweight and insecure in the early episodes) blossomed into a beautiful young woman and, thanks to her academic success in high school, was accepted into Columbia University. Ben ... was just Ben. In 1988, Maggie gave birth to a daughter, Chrissy; she was ""turned"" six in 1990. Mike, meanwhile, found his first true love in Kate (future real-life wife Chelsea Noble), and later took in homeless teen-ager Luke (a young Leonardo DiCaprio). Jason and Maggie's parents were also seen on occassion, as was the eternally-incompetent teacher Graham Lubbock (played by Bill Kirchenbauer, whose character was so popular it was spun off into ""Just the Ten of Us""). In the finale, Maggie accepts her dream job as media relations director for a U.S. senator, and they bid farewell to their home. The misadventures of a family with a home business father and a journalist mother.",0083413|0086827|0077003|0086687|0086681|0083479|0088576|0101120|0096579|0086787|0090501|0085109

0985991,Horrid Henry,"For Horrid Henry, life is just not fair! He feels that the rest of the world is against him and he wages a constant war against the tyranny of adults. Like any headstrong young boy, he is determined, relentless, he doesn't hold back and he never admits defeat! He will stop at nothing to outwit the enemy and teachers, relatives and babysitters avoid him at all costs. Even his parents argue over whose turn it is to look after him! Henry is endearingly straight forward and lives for the moment, he'll wolf down his little brother Peter's chocolates before even thinking of an alibi! He doesn't try to be truly horrid, it just comes naturally! He's still young, however, and can be scared by talk of ghosts or monsters. The school doctor's syringe reduces him to a quivering heap! Although Henry is certainly proud of himself, he never learns from his mistakes. Henry indulges in fantasies, transforms into terrifying creatures to match his frustrations and often has 'Eureka moments' when he has what he thinks is a spectacularly wonderful idea. In every story, there is something Henry has to get or do (or occasionally avoid doing) and the ensuing chaos is the consequence of this overriding desire. When he thinks of a plan it is simple to get his own way, never to make trouble purely for its own sake. He takes life very seriously and he sincerely believes in what he is doing. No wonder his favorite saying is ... 'it's not fair!!!!' To anyone who suffered at the hands of an older brother, be grateful you don't have a sibling like horrid henry. He can easily make a saint swear with his antics; Nanny 911, Supernanny, Little Angels, house of tiny tear-aways, none of the child specialists behind them could sort him out. Odd however since his brother, Peter is nothing like him, he's everything that Henry isn't and everything Henry's come to despise about how he (Henry) must behave. In short He (Henry) is proof that evolution can go in reverse, surprising his parents haven't packed him off to military school or put him up for adoption...then again he'd most likely be sent back home as neither organization could deal with him.",1684555|0363378|0381772|0329829|1817311|0233041|0313130|0217177|2023453|0284335|0313033|2319282

The teams enthusiasm is rekindled, but unknown to them, Charlie Browns learns that neither the girls nor his dog Snoopy would be allowed to play. With great difficulty, Charlie Brown has to make a difficult moral decision and live with the consequences. Charlie Brown's baseball team is pathetic (but you didn't have to be reminded of that), and after dropping two easy-as-pie pop flies in two games that would've helped them win, he doesn't deserve any slack either. So much so that the entire team finally decides to bail on him and enjoy summer like the other kids. Shortly after this happens, he gets a call from the owner of a local hardware store who wants to sponsor his team, bring them into organized little league, and (most importantly) get them uniforms. Charlie Brown manages to catch all the kids in one place and give them the good news. They get so excited at this idea that all of them (including the always crabby and skeptical Lucy) decide to pick up their caps, gloves, and bats and take the field again. Unfortunately, shortly thereafter, the hardware store owner calls again and breaks it to Charlie Brown that the league rules forbid him to have the girls and Snoopy on his team, so Charlie Brown makes the moral decision to keep the team together rather then accept the invitation and uniforms. However, now faced with the inevitable backlash from his team (especially the girls and Snoopy, who would've been disgusted with him no matter which choice he made), he decides to wait until the end of the next game in hopes that a victory would boost their morale to the point they'd stay together, no matter what he told them about this.

As Gardner tries to figure out how to sell them, his wife leaves him, he loses his house, his bank account, and credit cards. Forced to live out in the streets with his son, Gardner is now desperate to find a steady job; he takes on a job as a stockbroker, but before he can receive pay, he needs to go through 6 months of training, and to sell his devices. 1981, San Francisco. In what limited academic opportunities he has had in his life, Chris Gardner has demonstrated that he is a smart man. Yet he is struggling financially in his life. He has invested all his money on portable bone density scanners, which he personally sells to physicians. Despite being a better product than x-rays machines, they are also far more expensive, meaning that they are an unnecessary luxury for most physicians. He needs to sell three scanners per month just to meet the basic necessities to support his family, his wife, Linda, and their five year old son, Christopher, on who he dotes since he didn't know his own father when he was a child. But lately, that has been three per month more than he has sold, resulting in an increasing embittered Linda continually needing to work double shifts doing manual work at a laundry, which still isn't enough to cover those basic costs, they being currently behind three months rent. Chris can't afford to pay his parking ticket, meaning that he has to take the bus everywhere now as the clamp remains on the tire of his car. Feeling like the scanner is not the answer to their financial problems, Chris, with or without Linda's blessing, decides to take a chance by switching careers when he sees that brokerage and securities firm Dean Witter has a six month internship program, which only admits twenty applicants, leading to only one intern being hired at the end of the process. It isn't until he is well immersed into the process that he learns that the internships are non-paying. Based largely on his chutzpah, Chris, against the odds, gets one of the twenty positions. With some changes in their lives resulting in fewer expenses, Chris figures he needs to sell his remaining six scanners just to scrape by for those six months. But some unexpected issues arise which leads to the Gardners possibly not making it through this phase of their lives financially, something he has to hide from his superiors at Dean Witter if he has any chance at all of making it through the internship and getting that paying job with them.

Jennifer was the precocious youngster who just wanted to be a normal kid. Skippy Handleman, one of Alex's best friends, was a geeky next-door neighbor with an unrequited crush on Mallory. During the 1984-1985 season, Elyse gave birth to Andrew, her and Steven's fourth child. Alex quickly took his young brother under his wing, and before long Andrew was reading the Wall Street Journal over his Froot Loops cereal. As the years passed, Alex graduated from high school (as salutatorian) and pursued a financial degree from Leland College. It was there he met his first serious girlfriend, the beautiful Ellen Reed (played by Fox's future wife, Tracy Pollan). After that relationship ended, Alex met psychology major Lauren Miller. Meanwhile, Mallory (who was in serious danger of flunking out of high school) found love in the form of Rambo-wannabe and high school-dropout Nick Moore, of whom Steven and Elyse (at least initially) strongly disapproved; Alex disliked the motorcycle-riding Nick even more. Mallory, however, did graduate from high school and became a fashion design major at Grant College. Nick also obtained his general-equivalency diploma. While there was time for fun and laughs, many episodes explored serious topics, such as: teen pregnancy, censorship, addiction to pills, the effects racial minority homeowners have on property values and grieving the loss of a close friend. Other episodes dealt with Steven's distant relationships with his own family, particularly his brother, Robert, while plenty of episodes presented flashbacks of earlier episodes featuring the Keaton offspring as young children. By the time the series wrapped up, Alex accepted his dream job offer...a job on New York's Wall Street. Chronicles liberal ex-hippies Steven and Elyse Keaton, their conservative son Alex, daughters Mallory and Jennifer, and later, youngest child Andrew.",0088527|0086827|0086687|0077003|0070992|0101120|0077053|0086681|0063878|0090390|0083479|0096579

0125616,Double Dare,"Two teams of two children, ages 9 through 13, competed in this classic kiddie game show of questions and physical challenges. At the beginning of each show, the two teams (each with such names as ""Wacky Wormheads"" or ""Slimy Superkids"") competed in a physical challenge (described below). The winner of the physical challenge would gain control of the first round questions. Host Summers asked the question, to which the team could answer for $10 or ""dare"" (i.e., challenge) the opposing team to answer for $20. However, the opponents could ""double dare"" (ergo, challenge back) the original team to answer; the original team could then answer for $40 or complete a ""physical challenge,"" an often messy stunt that had to be completed within 10, 15, 20, or 30 seconds. ""Physical challenge"" stunts could include one team member wrapping his/her partner in a giant ""tortilla shell"" and drop hot sauce on it; having to throw three balloons filled with fingerpaint at a target, while having to select from a tub that also had water balloons inside; and catapulting condiments onto a giant hamburger while the partner held the bun and patty. Completing the physical challenge was worth $20; however, losing the physical challenge meant the other team got the money and control of the questions. The opposing team also got control of the questions if the other team answered incorrectly (as well as the cash if the question was dared or double-dared). Two rounds were played, with the second round values worth $20, $40 and $80. The team with the most money after two rounds won and advanced to the Double Dare Obstacle Course, a series of eight often very messy obstacles the team had to clear within 60 seconds to win a grand prize. Each team member alternated duties, but each time, the object was to retrieve a flag and hand it to his/her partner. Each flag was worth a prize, and if the team retrieved all eight flags, they won a grand prize (usually a trip). Several variants of ""Double Dare"" aired through the years, including a family version and a syndicated ""Super Sloppy"" entry (similar to the above description, except the stunts were exponentially messier). One in a long-running series of game shows, where two-member teams of children compete to answer questions and complete stunts.",0078714|0127994|0096610|0220895|0092457|0085060|0283721|0115283|0166048|0094459|0121967|0106172

Just a few years later, the FBI tracks him down in France; he's extradited, tried, and jailed for passing more than $4,000,000 in bad checks. Along the way, he's posed as a Pan Am pilot, a pediatrician, and an attorney. And, from nearly the beginning of this life of crime, he's been pursued by a dour FBI agent, Carl Hanratty. What starts as cat and mouse becomes something akin to father and son. A true story about",1130884|0450259|0217505|0338751|0993846|0268978|0407887|1343092|0120382|0120338|0120689|0120815

2994382,Window Wonderland,"It's no holds barred when two Manhattan department store employees vie for the same job during the busy Christmas season. Sloan Van Doren is a driven young woman determined to become the next window dresser at McGuire's department store and to uphold a 95-year-old artistic holiday tradition. Serious and professional, she's the polar opposite of the happy-go-lucky Jake Dooley, who also wants the job. When Mr. Fitch, the head of advertising and promotion, gives them a challenge, the competition is on: each will create a series of seasonal storefront windows twice a week until Christmas. The creator of whichever window display gets the most attention from passersby will get the job. As they go through their paces, with Jake's obvious talent grabbing the public's attention, a silent but mutual attraction develops between the pair, hampered by the contest and the presence of Kenneth, Sloan's blueblood boyfriend, who can't understand the importance Sloan is placing on this job. Supporting the efforts of the window dressers are McGuire's veteran window washer Mac (Terence Kelly) and brassy bathroom attendant Rita who have eyes for each other but haven't done anything about it yet. Love is in the air at McGuire's, but things aren't exactly what they seem. Who will win in this love triangle? McGuire's Department Store has a ninety-five year tradition of having the best Christmas window displays in New York City. That tradition is in jeopardy this year as its two decade senior designer, Miss T. Jeffers, has quit at the start of the Christmas season, taking most of her design staff to work at a competitor, except Sloan Van Doren, a two year member of the design team, and recent hire Jake Dooley. There is no time to hire an experienced replacement, so Fitch, the store manager, based on an initial assessment of their skills, gives Sloan and Jake each one of the two display windows to decorate for the Christmas season, the displays to be changed once a week, meaning four designs apiece. The one whose windows draw in the most customers to the store will be the new ""Miss Jeffers"". Sloan and Jake are opposite personalities, with specifically Sloan's opinion of Jake being low, despite neither truly knowing anything of the other. Based on her pretentious sounding name, her ever changing well-appointed business attire, her expensive academic background, the constant telephone calls from her mother that he overhears, and dating snobbish upper crust Wall Streeter Kenneth (not Ken or Kenny) Carlyle, Jake assumes meticulous Sloan grew up in privilege, with lawn parties and country clubs being the norm. Sloan believes slacker Jake has always skated by life on his superficial charms, but she also admits that he is very talented, that natural talent which she wishes she possessed. Despite her outward confidence, Sloan is a bundle of insecurities as she tries to get ahead in the business. As the two compete for the job as Miss Jeffers, they begin to get to know each other beyond the fa?ades, their feelings toward life, the top job and each other affected by their relationships with Kenneth, Mac, the store's window cleaner, and Rita, the brash ladies' room attendant. A department-store window decorator learns there is a vacancy for her dream job in the run-up to Christmas, only to find a professional rival has his eye on it too.",4177742|2374486|4065316|3214240|1264895|3131532|0385567|2355762|2064865|3320502|4160132|4159212
